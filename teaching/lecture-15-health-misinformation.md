## Overview
Misinformation and disinformation are now among the greatest obstacles to evidence-based healthcare and effective public health policy. In this lecture, Dr. Jay Varma explores how false and misleading claims spread, why they can be so difficult to correct, and the harm they cause to health decisions and population outcomes. Drawing on examples from COVID-19, measles, and polio, he reviews the science of misinformation, challenges of debunking, and the ethical debates over government regulation and industry responsibility.

Students will learn frameworks for identifying misinformation, strategies for effective risk communication, and evidence-based approaches to counter harmful narratives. The lecture emphasizes the role of trust, empathy, and transparency in maintaining credibility and protecting public health.
