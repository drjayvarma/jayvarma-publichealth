## Overview
How do policymakers and clinicians apply scientific evidence to complex, real-world situations? In this lecture, Dr. Jay Varma guides learners through decision-making scenarios that test the application of the GRADE framework and other evidence-to-decision tools.

Students will work through cases ranging from vaccine exemption policies to the expansion of universal health insurance. Each example illustrates how to balance benefits, harms, costs, feasibility, ethics, and equity when evidence is imperfect or incomplete.

3. Weighing costs, feasibility, and ethics alongside evidence quality
