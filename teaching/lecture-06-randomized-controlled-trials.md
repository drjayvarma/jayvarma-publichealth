## Overview
What makes randomized controlled trials (RCTs) the gold standard of evidence, and what are their limitations? In this lecture, Dr. Jay Varma provides a comprehensive, practical guide to designing, interpreting, and critiquing RCTs used in healthcare and public health decision making.

From patient enrollment to allocation concealment, statistical power to intention-to-treat analysis, youâ€™ll learn how RCTs are built to reduce bias and establish causality. Youâ€™ll also explore when RCTs may be unethical, impractical, or misleading, and why thoughtful trial design matters as much as data.

## Key Topics Covered
1. Design of randomized controlled trials (RCTs)  
2. Randomization methods, allocation concealment, and blinding  
3. Superiority vs. non-inferiority trials  
4. Intention-to-treat vs. per-protocol analysis  
5. Trial registration, CONSORT reporting, and ethical considerations  
6. When RCTs are inappropriate or infeasible  
7. How to critically appraise RCT evidence for public health practice
