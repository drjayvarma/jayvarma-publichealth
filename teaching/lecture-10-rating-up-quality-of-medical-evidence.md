## Overview
This lecture by Dr. Jay K. Varma explains how certain study findings can increase our confidence in scientific resultsâ€”specifically when assessing observational studies. Using the GRADE framework, the lecture details the three primary reasons for rating up the quality of evidence: **large magnitude of effect**, **dose-response gradient**, and **plausible residual confounding**.

## Key Topics Covered
1. What qualifies as a large effect and how it supports causal inference  
2. Examples of dose-response relationships from drug therapy, psychotherapy, and public health interventions  
3. How unmeasured or residual confounding may bias findings toward the null  
4. Case examples including SIDS prevention, bicycle helmet effectiveness, and metformin safety  
5. Applying GRADE in real-world policy and clinical decision-making
