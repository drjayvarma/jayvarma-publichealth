## Overview
How do we know what causes disease, and what prevents disease? In this lecture, Dr. Jay Varma introduces the major types of study designs used in healthcare and public health. You’ll learn how to distinguish descriptive, analytical, observational, and experimental studies, and how each fits into the broader hierarchy of scientific evidence.

Using a memorable and simple example (candy and heart attacks), this presentation brings clarity to concepts like randomized controlled trials, case-control studies, cohort studies, and causal inference. The lecture also critiques the limitations of the “evidence hierarchy” and explores Bradford Hill’s criteria for determining causality.

2. Observational vs. experimental methods  
3. Case-control, cohort, cross-sectional, and RCTs
