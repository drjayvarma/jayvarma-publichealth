## Overview
How do we organize and present research findings so they can be applied to real-world healthcare decisions? In this lecture, Dr. Jay Varma explains the process of preparing medical evidence for policy and practice, including how to summarize results, rate certainty, and integrate considerations beyond the science itself—such as cost, feasibility, ethics, and public acceptability.

Students will learn to develop clear, structured evidence profiles and summary tables that help decision-makers weigh the benefits and harms of interventions. Through examples from infectious disease prevention, chronic disease management, and health systems policy, Dr. Varma illustrates how to bridge the gap between research and actionable recommendations.
