## Overview
This lecture by Dr. Jay K. Varma explores three critical reasons for downgrading the quality of scientific evidence using the GRADE framework: **imprecision**, **inconsistency**, and **indirectness**. These factors commonly lead to reduced confidence in research findings and may weaken clinical or public health recommendations.

## Key Topics Covered
1. How wide confidence intervals and small sample sizes affect imprecision  
2. When heterogeneity in study results becomes inconsistency  
3. The role of indirectness due to surrogate outcomes, non-equivalent populations, or interventions  
4. Tools such as optimal information size (OIS), IÂ² statistics, and subgroup analysis  
5. Real-world case examples, including ALS drug trials and systematic reviews
