## Overview
How do we combine and make sense of multiple studies to guide better healthcare decisions? In this lecture, Dr. Jay Varma introduces the principles, process, and pitfalls of systematic reviews and meta-analyses — two of the most powerful tools in evidence-based medicine and health policy.

Students will learn how to define a clear research question, search and screen the literature, abstract and synthesize data, and interpret pooled results using statistical methods. Real-world examples, including the case of rofecoxib (Vioxx), illustrate the power and responsibility of evidence synthesis in clinical practice and regulation.
