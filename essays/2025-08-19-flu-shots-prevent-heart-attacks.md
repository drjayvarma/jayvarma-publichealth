## Key Points

* Influenza infection can trigger heart attacks through inflammation and plaque rupture.
* Flu vaccines reduce heart attack risk by 18–30 percent, especially in people with heart disease.
* U.S. and European heart societies recommend annual flu shots for cardiac patients.
* Benefits of flu vaccination rival those of statins and blood pressure meds in high-risk groups.

Every August, primary care doctors stock their clinics with influenza vaccines and start reminding patients to get their annual shot. We usually tell patients, “The flu vaccine can reduce your risk of severe illness during the upcoming respiratory virus season.” While that’s true and important, there’s another important reason to get vaccinated: reducing your risk of a heart attack.

## Do Infections Trigger Heart Attacks?

Doctors have long recognized that people are more likely to have a heart attack or stroke in the days or weeks after certain infections, especially those that affect the lungs, like influenza. There are three ways in which influenza is thought to trigger cardiovascular events.

First, after infection, the body mounts a rapid, powerful immune response that includes a surge of inflammatory chemicals and clotting factors. If your arteries have any fatty deposits (known as “plaques”) in their walls, inflammation can destabilize the plaques, clots can form at those rupture points, and blood flow to part of the heart can be blocked.

Second, studies in mice and tissue cultures show that influenza can directly infect the cells that line blood vessels, disrupt their normal function, and persist in arterial plaques.

Finally, influenza raises heart rate, increases oxygen demand, and can lower blood pressure. All of these can stress an already weakened cardiovascular system.

These combined effects are part of why people with heart disease are more likely to be hospitalized or die during influenza season, even if they don’t have a severe case of the flu.

## What Is the Flu Vaccine?

The most common way to prevent influenza is by getting a vaccine; the most commonly used version in adults is the inactivated influenza vaccine. It contains killed versions of the flu virus strains most likely to circulate during the upcoming season.

The vaccine prompts the body to build an immune response without triggering the intense inflammation caused by the actual virus. The vaccine needs to be reformulated every year because the virus changes frequently and immunity wanes over time.

Other versions of the vaccine, such as those containing more viral antigens (“high dose”) or additional ingredients (“adjuvanted”), are also available to stimulate a stronger immune response in older adults.

## Will the Flu Vaccine Prevent Heart Attacks?

The evidence is now clear from randomized trials, meta-analyses, and large observational studies that flu vaccination reduces the risk of heart attacks and other major cardiovascular events.

In the general population, receiving the flu vaccine is associated with an 18–30 percent reduction in the risk of heart attacks. In people with pre-existing cardiovascular disease, the benefits are even more striking. A 2021 randomized clinical trial found that people vaccinated shortly after hospitalization for a heart attack had a 28 percent lower risk of dying, having another heart attack, or needing urgent revascularization over the following year compared with those who received a placebo. A 2023 meta-analysis that pooled results from over 9,000 individuals found a 45 percent reduction in the death rate among those with a history of heart disease who received the flu vaccine.

Remarkably, this benefit level is similar to other medications used to prevent heart attacks, such as blood pressure drugs and statins for reducing cholesterol. Unlike daily medications, which need to be taken daily, a flu vaccination happens just once a year.

## Who Recommends the Flu Vaccine to Prevent Heart Attacks?

In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends annual flu vaccination for everyone six months of age and older. The rationale is to prevent severe illness, hospitalizations, and transmission. Protecting your heart should now be considered an added incentive to get the flu vaccine, particularly for adults over 50 and those with cardiac risk factors.

The American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology recommend annual flu vaccination for all adults with coronary artery disease or other atherosclerotic vascular conditions. They consider it part of routine secondary prevention, alongside cholesterol management, smoking cessation, and blood pressure control.

Guidelines from Europe also recommend flu vaccination for patients with chronic coronary syndromes, heart failure, or other forms of cardiovascular disease. They further advise vaccination during hospitalization for acute heart disease, including during or immediately after a heart attack.

## Will You Get Your Flu Shot This Year?

Despite strong recommendations and reliable evidence, flu vaccination rates remain suboptimal. Many people underestimate the dangers of influenza, especially if they are healthy or have had mild illness in the past. Others are unaware that the flu vaccine might help prevent events they fear far more than the flu itself, such as a heart attack.

I recommend annual flu vaccination for all of my adult patients, but it is particularly important if you have any risk factors for heart disease.
