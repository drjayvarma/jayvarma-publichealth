## Key Points

* Alaska sees a tenfold rise in severe, invasive gonorrhea infections since 2022.
* Widespread screening, diagnosis, and treatment are needed to prevent STIs.
* Nearly 90 percent of Alaska’s cases have required hospitalization.

A dangerous form of gonorrhea is spreading in Alaska, according to state health officials. At the same time, two essential programs at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to stop outbreaks like this have just been cut as part of a massive wave of changes occurring to federal health programs. What’s happening in Alaska could be a warning sign for what might happen to sexual health in other places soon.

## What Is Gonorrhea, and Why Do We Worry About It?

Gonorrhea is a sexually transmitted infection (STI) caused by the bacteria *Neisseria gonorrhoeae*. It spreads through vaginal, anal, or oral sex, infecting the genitals, rectum, or throat. Untreated infections can lead to infertility in both men and women.

Many people with gonorrhea have no symptoms and can only be diagnosed with laboratory tests. When symptoms do occur, they can include pain with urination, genital discharge, or pelvic pain. Gonorrhea is diagnosed with a relatively simple lab test—usually a swab of the genitalia or a urine specimen sent to a lab for PCR testing.

One of the important challenges of gonorrhea is that the bacteria can adapt and evade antibiotics. Currently, the only reliably effective treatment for gonorrhea is an injected antibiotic, ceftriaxone.

## The New STD Threat in Alaska

Since 2023, an increasing number of people in Alaska have been showing up at emergency departments with a rare complication of gonorrhea known as “disseminated gonococcal infection.” Instead of burning when they urinate, patients have fever and swollen joints, and, in some cases, infected heart valves. In these cases, gonorrhea bacteria spread from the genitals or throat into the bloodstream and other organs.

Nearly 90 percent of patients in Alaska’s recent outbreak have required hospitalization. Some needed surgery. Nearly half the patients had co-existing conditions such as HIV, hepatitis C, or substance use disorder. Most required invasive medical procedures.

Looking back at data from previous years, state health department epidemiologists discovered there has been a **tenfold increase** in disseminated gonorrhea infections between 2022 and 2024.

What’s driving this outbreak? Health officials worry that it could be a new mutated strain of the bacteria, combined with sexual exposures and delayed screening in a medically vulnerable population. This is exactly the kind of outbreak in which health departments usually turn to the nation’s experts at the CDC.

## The First Line of Defense

As part of recent cuts to public health, on April 1, 2025, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services eliminated two critical CDC teams:

* **STD Laboratory Reference and Research Branch**
* **Disease Intervention and Response Branch**

These were part of the nation’s line of defense against outbreaks like Alaska’s. The now-closed laboratory branch maintained a repository of over 50,000 gonorrhea isolates, conducted 20,000 antibiotic susceptibility tests annually, and provided technical assistance to local labs. They were critical in confirming diagnoses, monitoring trends, and responding quickly to treatment failures.

Now, states like Alaska must confront outbreaks largely on their own. While some areas may have strong local labs, many lack the expertise to detect resistance patterns. Commercial labs, which perform most STD testing in the U.S., typically do not test for antibiotic resistance.

## How Do CDC Staff Support States?

The cut to the **Disease Intervention and Response Branch** may be even more damaging in the short term. For decades, the CDC has deployed field staff to work directly in state and local health departments.

These staff:

* Interview patients
* Link them and their partners to care
* Support outbreak response and surge control

In Alaska, where the rise in disseminated gonorrhea is linked to a concentrated sexual network, such field-based partner services are crucial.

But federal staff are now being recalled—just as the U.S. faces rising congenital syphilis and persistently high chlamydia rates.

## Public Health Programs Are Needed to Stop STIs

There are no vaccines for gonorrhea, chlamydia, or syphilis. Prevention depends on:

* **Early diagnosis and treatment** of infected people
* **Identification and treatment of partners** before further spread

When federal support disappears, state and local health agencies lose the ability to intervene early. STI outbreaks rarely stay local—they spread through social and sexual networks shaped by poverty, stigma, housing instability, and lack of care.

The result: more hospitalizations, infertility, and higher costs—financial, psychological, and societal.

## How We Can Promote Sexual Health

Experts have called for restoration of the CDC’s STI laboratory and field services. Without them, dangerous strains may spread unchecked.

In the meantime:

* Screen sexually active teens and adults regularly
* Test for gonorrhea in patients with unexplained joint pain or fever, especially with risk factors like HIV or substance use
* Strengthen local public health systems through advocacy and community action

And if you’re sexually active: **get tested—and make sure your partners do, too.**
