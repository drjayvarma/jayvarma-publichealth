## Key Points

* Alaska sees a tenfold rise in severe, invasive gonorrhea infections since 2022.
* Widespread screening, diagnosis, and treatment are needed to prevent STIs.
* Nearly 90 percent of Alaska’s cases have required hospitalization.

A dangerous form of gonorrhea is spreading in Alaska, according to state health officials. At the same time, two essential programs at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to stop outbreaks like this have just been cut as part of a massive wave of changes occurring to federal health programs. What’s happening in Alaska could be a warning sign for what might happen to sexual health in other places soon.

## What Is Gonorrhea, and Why Do We Worry About It?

Gonorrhea is a sexually transmitted infection (STI) caused by the bacteria *Neisseria gonorrhoeae*. It spreads through vaginal, anal, or oral sex, infecting the genitals, rectum, or throat. Untreated infections can lead to infertility in both men and women.

Many people with gonorrhea have no symptoms and can only be diagnosed with laboratory tests. When symptoms do occur, they can include pain with urination, genital discharge, or pelvic pain. Gonorrhea is diagnosed with a relatively simple lab test—usually a swab of the genitalia or a urine specimen sent to a lab for polymerase chain reaction (PCR).

One of the important challenges of gonorrhea is that the bacteria can adapt and evade antibiotics. Currently, the only reliably effective treatment for gonorrhea is an injected antibiotic, ceftriaxone.

## The New STD Threat in Alaska

Since 2023, an increasing number of people in Alaska have been showing up at emergency departments with a rare complication of gonorrhea known as “disseminated gonococcal infection.” Instead of burning when they urinate, patients have fever and swollen joints, and, in some cases, infected heart valves. In these cases, gonorrhea bacteria spread from the genitals or throat into the bloodstream and other organs.

Nearly 90 percent of patients in Alaska’s recent outbreak have required hospitalization. Some needed surgery. Nearly half the patients had co-existing conditions such as HIV, hepatitis C, or substance use disorder. Most required invasive medical procedures.

Looking back at data from previous years, state health department epidemiologists discovered there has been a tenfold increase in disseminated gonorrhea infections between 2022 and 2024.

What’s driving this outbreak? Health officials worry that it could be a new mutated strain of the bacteria, combined with sexual exposures and delayed screening in a medically vulnerable population. This is exactly the kind of outbreak in which health departments usually turn to the nation’s experts at the CDC.

## The First Line of Defense

As part of its recent cuts to public health, on April 1, 2025, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services eliminated two critical teams at the CDC: Its STD Laboratory Reference and Research Branch and its Disease Intervention and Response Branch.

These expert federal teams are part of the nation’s line of defense against outbreaks like the one in Alaska. CDC’s now-closed STD Laboratory Reference and Research Branch was a national hub for detecting dangerous new strains of gonorrhea. The staff there maintained a repository of over 50,000 gonorrhea isolates, conducted 20,000 antibiotic susceptibility tests annually, and provided technical assistance to local labs nationwide. They helped state and local health departments confirm diagnoses, monitor trends, and respond quickly when treatments failed.

States like Alaska must now confront outbreaks largely on their own. While some areas may have strong local laboratories, many lack the resources or expertise to detect emerging resistance patterns. Commercial laboratories, which handle most routine STD testing in the U.S., do not routinely test for antibiotic resistance.

## How Do CDC Staff Support States?

The second cut to the Disease Intervention and Response Branch may be even more damaging in the short term. For decades, the CDC has deployed field staff to work within state and local health departments. These staff do essential work for controlling STIs: Interviewing patients, linking them and their partners to care, and helping jurisdictions respond to outbreaks and other surges in infections.

In Alaska, where the increase in disseminated gonorrhea is suspected to involve a concentrated sexual network, field-based contact tracing and partner services have been crucial to detecting this outbreak and reducing further infections.

But federal staff are now being recalled. The loss of on-the-ground responders comes at a time when the U.S. has also seen rising rates of congenital syphilis and persistently high rates of chlamydia infection.

## Public Health Programs Are Needed to Stop STIs

There are no vaccines to prevent the most common and problematic STIs—chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis. Prevention, therefore, depends primarily on early diagnosis and treatment of infected people, and identification and treatment of their sexual partners before infections spread further in the community. This is exactly the type of work that federal field staff support.

When federal support is removed, state and local public health agencies lose the ability to intervene early. STI outbreaks rarely stay confined to one community. They spread through the complex web of human relationships, shaped by poverty, stigma, housing instability, and inadequate access to care. This leads to more hospitalizations, more people with infertility, and higher costs—not just financial, but psychological and societal.

## How We Can Promote Sexual Health

Health experts from around the country have called for the restoration of the CDC’s STI laboratory and field services branches, arguing that this is important to preserve health and stop diseases, like gonorrhea, before they become harder and more expensive to control.

We can also screen sexually active teens and adults for infections, and remain vigilant for gonorrhea in patients with unexplained joint pain or fevers, especially if they have risk factors like substance use or HIV.

If you’re concerned about public health, work with people in your community to strengthen services. And, if you’re a patient, don’t wait. Get tested regularly if you’re sexually active. And make sure your partners get tested too.
