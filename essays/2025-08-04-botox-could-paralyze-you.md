## Key Points

* Botox is a powerful toxin that can cause life-threatening paralysis when used improperly.
* Dozens have been hospitalized after getting fake or mishandled botulinum toxin injections.
* Many med spas operate with little oversight and use providers lacking proper training or credentials.
* Ask if your provider is licensed, uses FDA-approved Botox, and has medical supervision on site.

More Americans than ever are treating their wrinkles with botulinum toxin ("Botox") or similar neuromodulator injections. In 2024, almost 10 million Americans received a Botox injection, close to double the number in 2019. What happens when those injections go wrong, as they did in June in Massachusetts?

In Milton, Massachusetts, 12 adults got botulinum toxin injections at a medical spa, then soon developed unusual symptoms, such as blurred vision, drooping eyelids, slurred speech, and difficulty breathing. What they had was botulism, a rare and potentially lethal disease caused by the toxin found in anti-wrinkle injections.

How did they get botulism? How can you make sure you don’t have the same Botox complication?

## What is Botox, and What Does It Have to Do with Botulism?

Botox comes from a toxin produced by the bacteria *Clostridium botulinum*. It is, by weight, the most potent toxin known to humans, blocking nerve signals that cause muscles to contract. Because this toxin is so powerful and long-lasting, tiny injections can temporarily paralyze the muscles in your face, preventing the muscle contractions that cause wrinkles.

Before it became known for its cosmetic uses, the toxin was known as one of the most dangerous forms of food poisoning. When food is improperly prepared or stored, especially during home canning, it can get contaminated with the bacteria’s spores, and, under the right conditions, the spores can produce this toxin.

Outbreaks of foodborne botulism are considered a public health emergency, because after eating contaminated food, people can start to develop symptoms of paralysis within 12 hours and progress to the point where they cannot breathe without being on a ventilator. The only treatment is the use of a special antitoxin.

When I was doing my training in CDC’s Epidemic Intelligence Service, I used to have to carry the “bot pager” a few weeks every year. When this pager buzzed, it meant a doctor suspected that a patient had botulism and needed me to authorize the release of botulism antitoxin from the federal government’s national stockpile.

Unfortunately, if people do not get the antitoxin early enough, it may have already blocked their nerve endings, leaving them dependent on a mechanical ventilator to breathe for them until the toxin wears off.

## Is Botulism a Common Complication of Botox?

Unfortunately, what happened in Massachusetts is becoming more common. In April 2024, the CDC issued a nationwide health advisory after identifying botulism cases in 11 states from injections.

Twenty-two patients, all aged 25 to 59, got sick from what they thought were routine botulinum toxin injections for wrinkle treatment. Eleven required hospitalization, and none died.

Most had received their injections from unlicensed or poorly trained providers, often in informal settings like spas or private homes. The toxin they received was either counterfeit or improperly administered botulinum or both.

Medical spas are regulated differently in each state. In most states, botulinum toxin can be administered by aestheticians or nurses without a physician physically on-site. A physician may simply be registered to oversee the clinic without playing any substantive role in training, supervision, and quality control.

In most cases, complications result from errors in the procedure. Botulinum toxin must be precisely dosed, reconstituted with sterile saline, and injected into specific anatomical targets. If the provider makes a mistake in diluting the product, loading the correct dose, or injecting it, you might end up with paralysis of more than just your facial muscles.

In some situations, however, providers may unknowingly use counterfeit products that contain too much toxin, the wrong toxin subtype, or bacterial contaminants. Last year, the FDA and CDC warned about counterfeit botulinum toxin circulating in the U.S., sometimes even in facilities that appear legitimate. The counterfeit versions often mimic the packaging of FDA-approved products but contain incorrect lot numbers, mislabeled ingredients, or non-standard doses. In some cases, the packaging is not even in English.

## Why People Get Botox, and How to Do It Safely

For some people, cosmetic treatments can offer real psychological benefits, boosting self-esteem, improving confidence, and alleviating anxiety. As more and more people seek out these benefits in both mental health and physical appearance, including more people under 30, it’s important to understand how to make sure you have these procedures done safely.

First, verify that the person giving the injection is a licensed professional trained in administering botulinum toxin. This varies by state but should be confirmable through a state medical, nursing, or aesthetician licensing board. Some states also require that the spa or clinic itself be licensed.

Second, ask questions. Who is supervising this procedure medically? What are their credentials? Is the botulinum toxin product FDA-approved? Was it purchased from a licensed source?

If you have any doubts, consider skipping that facility and finding one that can assure your safety. After you receive your injection, watch out for any unusual symptoms. If you do experience double vision, drooping eyelids, slurred speech, difficulty swallowing, or breathing problems hours or days after the injection, go to an emergency room immediately.
