## Key Points

* Lenacapavir offers twice-yearly HIV prevention with near-complete protection in clinical trials.
* Clinical trials show striking effectiveness across diverse populations at high risk for HIV.
* Long-acting injections may overcome adherence and access barriers compared with daily oral PrEP.
* Health systems must adapt to deliver long-acting PrEP amid cuts to government health insurance and programs.

In June, the US Food and Drug Administration approved a new drug that could transform HIV prevention. People at risk of HIV can get an injection of lenacapavir every six months and be almost completely protected from getting infected. For anyone who is sexually active, it's important to understand what this means for you and the future of the HIV/AIDS epidemic in the U.S.

## How Do We Prevent HIV Infections Now?

Since the emergence of HIV in the 1980s, HIV prevention has relied on three main strategies: behavior, barriers, and biomedicine.

During the first three decades of the epidemic, the response emphasized the first two pillars. Behavioral approaches focused on reducing high-risk practices, such as condomless sex, needle sharing, and concurrent sexual partners. Barrier interventions focused on increasing access to condoms. These strategies helped slow HIV's spread, but they were not sufficient to end the epidemic.

In 2010, the publication of two landmark clinical trials initiated a shift in strategy. One trial showed that people without HIV infection could take antiretroviral medications to prevent getting infected. The second trial showed that people with HIV infection could take antiretroviral medications to suppress the virus so that they do not spread it to their sexual partners. This approach is known as “U=U” or “Undetectable = Untransmittable.”

These findings catalyzed a major shift in health policy toward biomedical prevention: using medications to protect people at risk and to make infected people non-infectious to others. The clinics where I work now practice “status neutral care.” Every sexually active teenager or adult is offered HIV testing. If they are negative, they are offered pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). If they are positive, they are offered HIV treatment.

In 2019, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force gave PrEP a grade “A” recommendation, requiring insurers to cover it with no out-of-pocket costs. That same year, the federal government launched its “End the HIV Epidemic” initiative, making biomedical prevention and treatment the central pillars of its national strategy.

## If We Can Prevent HIV Infections, Why Is There an HIV Epidemic?

What’s effective for one person, unfortunately, is not always effective for millions of people. The most common form of PrEP (oral pills taken daily) requires health insurance, quarterly testing for sexually transmitted infections, and a high degree of adherence. That does not work for many people at high risk for HIV infection.

The virus continues to infect over 30,000 Americans each year, even though HIV is now entirely preventable and treatable. Most of these new infections occur in people with the greatest barriers to insurance, respectful sexual health care, housing, transporation, and employment. The vast majority of new infections are in gay and bisexual men, transgender women, people living in the South, and people of color.

## Could A New HIV Drug Act Like a Vaccine for HIV?

Lenacapavir is the first of a new class of drugs that interfere with the "capsid" of the HIV virus, the protein shell that surrounds its genetic material. Several factors make it uniquely suited to be given as an injection that lasts at least 26 weeks. Lenacapavir is potent at low doses, it takes a long time to clear from the body, and the injection under the skin creates a depot of the drug that gets slowly introduced into the bloodstream.

The first large clinical trial in 2024 demonstrated lenacapavir’s effectiveness in women. The PURPOSE 1 trial enrolled more than 5,300 adolescent girls and young women in South Africa and Uganda, a group with some of the highest HIV incidence rates globally. Over the course of the study, there were zero new HIV infections in the lenacapavir group, compared with 39 and 16 infections in two oral PrEP comparison groups. The background incidence was estimated at 2.41 per 100 person-years, which makes the result in the lenacapavir group (0 infections!) remarkable.

A second trial, PURPOSE 2, extended these findings to cisgender men, transgender women, and nonbinary individuals who have sex with men. This study found a 96 percent reduction in HIV incidence compared to background rates.

## What are the Challenges with Using Lenacapavir?

At the individual level, the most common adverse effects were mild injection site reactions, reported in more than two-thirds of participants.

Unlike daily oral PrEP, where a missed dose can be remedied quickly by taking more pills, long-acting agents leave behind a pharmacologic “tail,” a period when drug levels are too low to protect against infection but still high enough to select for drug-resistant virus strains if exposure occurs. In the PURPOSE 2 trials, two infections in lenacapavir treated group demonstrated the drug may not work if dosing is delayed or missed, and those two infections were caused by drug-resistant virus strains.

At the population level, health systems will need to develop new infrastructure: clinics that can administer injections on schedule, systems to remind and recall patients, and enhanced surveillance to monitor for drug resistance. With impending cuts to Medicaid and other health programs, I and many others are concerned, however, that the biggest barrier will be patient access to health care.

## Should You Take Lenacapavir to Prevent HIV?

If you have multiple sexual partners, I recommend you read up about PrEP and look at the various options available, especially now that we have a way to prevent infections with only two injections a year. Also, keep in mind that there may be even more good news on the horizon. A once-yearly injection on lenacapavir may be possible. Early results have been positive, and a Phase III clinical trial is expected to launch later in 2025.

Now that new tools are emerging to end the HIV epidemic, the most important challenge will be whether our public health and healthcare systems can deliver them to everyone that needs them.
