Reports of monkeypox, Ebola, polio and the ongoing coronavirus pandemic are unnerving but not surprising.

**Q:** It feels like viruses are all over the news, whether it’s monkeypox, Ebola, polio or the coronavirus. Are there more outbreaks now than usual?

**A:** Several factors help explain why we’re hearing so much about viral outbreaks. Shifts in migration and travel patterns, global eating habits and the effects of climate change have created new opportunities for microbes to spread. Better testing and monitoring methods also mean we’re detecting these outbreaks sooner than in the past.

What we’re experiencing right now is likely to become the new way we live, forcing us to adapt to a riskier world, much like we did after 9/11. We’ve accepted that we have new rules around air travel, security and identification to prevent terrorism. We’re also going to have to accept changes in how we live and cope in this era of emerging infectious diseases.

Most infectious diseases that we consider “new” already exist in animals. Some animals don’t get sick from them but host them in their bodies. For example, the HIV epidemic started when humans came into contact with an animal (in this case, chimpanzees). The virus spilled over from chimpanzees into humans and began spreading from human to human. With HIV, that spillover likely occurred in the early 1900s, but it took decades until scientists realized it was killing people.

Our ability to detect new diseases through laboratory testing is getting better every day, so public health agencies are detecting new threats faster. But this doesn’t completely explain why so many new infections have emerged or why so many old infections, such as polio, have returned.

One way to think about this is like a sports competition: The bacteria, viruses and other microscopic threats are playing offense, and the systems we’ve created to detect and respond to infectious diseases are playing defense. Over the past 20 years, the offense has gotten stronger, but our defense simply has not kept up.

Here are five reasons the microbes appear to be winning now:

1. **Humans are encroaching into animal environments.**
   The highest-risk places for new diseases to emerge are at the edge of forests and jungles. The animals that survive and thrive there—such as rats and bats—are also those most likely to carry infectious diseases dangerous to humans. Sometimes spillover is indirect, via insects such as ticks or mosquitoes.

2. **Humans are growing, trading and consuming animals in greater numbers.**
   As economies grow, people eat more protein. Larger numbers of animals are raised, concentrated, and shipped worldwide, increasing opportunities for diseases to spread among them and into humans. Drug-resistant “superbugs” often arise this way.

3. **Humans are concentrating in cities.**
   Dense populations make it easier for diseases to spread person-to-person. Many major cities worldwide have been shaped by past epidemics.

4. **Humans are moving more.**
   Migration and international travel mean new pathogens spread faster. New York, with its global connections, is often the first or hardest-hit U.S. city for emerging infections like Zika, COVID-19 and monkeypox.

5. **Climate change is accelerating all these factors.**
   Extreme weather, droughts, and temperature changes push humans, animals, and disease-carrying insects into new areas, bringing “tropical” diseases into regions previously untouched.

**So what can we do to stay safer?**

* Stay up to date on vaccinations.
* Maintain overall health by managing chronic diseases, getting enough sleep, exercising, eating well, and following medical advice.
* Stay informed about new threats and practice preparedness, like planning for pandemics or water contamination events.
* Support policies that strengthen public health systems and mitigate climate change.

No matter how scary the world may seem, you do have the ability to take action.
