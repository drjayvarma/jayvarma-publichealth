In recent months, the U.S. government has taken steps to defund and dismantle key infectious disease programs, including a National Institutes of Health lab that has contributed to groundbreaking work on HIV, Ebola, and other dangerous health threats.

These decisions reflect a broader, emerging worldview promoted by what I call "Germ Deniers"—individuals and groups who question or outright reject the established scientific understanding of how much microorganisms cause disease and death. This movement is gaining traction among influential figures in culture, healthcare, and media, and is now shaping public policy.

In this post, I explain who Germ Deniers are, what they believe, and why their growing influence endangers public health. In follow-up posts, I'll explore how we can recognize and counter this dangerous trend whether as health professionals or simply informed citizens.

## What Is Germ Theory and Why Does It Matter?

Germ theory is foundational to modern medicine and public health. It holds that some human diseases are caused by microscopic organisms—bacteria, viruses, fungi, or parasites—that spread between people, from animals to people, or through contact with the physical world. These microscopic organisms are known colloquially as "germs" or, among scientists, as "microbes." When microbes cause disease, they are also called "pathogens."

First confirmed in the 19th century by scientists like Louis Pasteur and Robert Koch, germ theory replaced older beliefs about why people become sick—like the idea that noxious fumes, an imbalance of bodily fluids, and moral failure caused most disease.

Germ theory led to some of the most important advances in human health: hand washing, vaccines, antibiotics, clean water systems, and improved hygiene practices in hospitals, schools, and restaurants. Together, advances in infectious disease control added an average of 29.2 years to life expectancy in the 20th century.

Germ theory reframed disease as the result of interactions between a microbe, the host (the person exposed), and the environment (conditions like crowding or poor ventilation). Importantly, the theory does not claim that microbes explain everything about illness and death. Not all human exposure to microbes leads to infection. Not all infections cause illness. And no intervention targeted at an infection—whether vaccines or medications—is 100% effective in 100% of people. But the tools germ theory gave us have saved hundreds of millions of lives.

Importantly, germ theory is also helping researchers understand cancer, heart attacks, dementia, and many other conditions, which likely have microbes as the causative agent or part of a combination of factors for their cause.

## Who Are Germ Deniers?

Germ Deniers represent a spectrum of individuals who minimize or reject the well-established role of microbes in causing disease.

While some extremists outright deny that germs cause illness, most acknowledge their existence but downplay their importance. Some argue that individual factors are the primary problem. A person only gets sick from a microbe because their immune system is weak because of malnutrition or other lifestyle factors. Others argue that other external factors are the "real" causes of most diseases, such as microplastics, food dyes, per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, mercury, and electromagnetic radiation.

## Are Microbes an Important Cause of Illness?

Germ Deniers espouse a set of beliefs that feel emotionally intuitive but are scientifically unfounded. Disregarding infectious diseases is, quite simply, wrong.

Globally, an enormous number of people die each year from HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria, along with a wide range of other bacteria and viruses that cause respiratory, intestinal, and bloodstream infections. Since its emergence in 2020, COVID-19, for example, remains among the top 10 causes of death in the U.S., despite claims by some officials that it was “a non-existent pandemic” that Americans have “moved on from.”

Many Germ Deniers argue that these deaths would not occur if people "boosted" their immune system through nutrition, exercise, and supplements. While people are more vulnerable to severe illness and death when they are malnourished or have other health conditions, germs alone can cause disease in otherwise healthy people.

Influencers are increasingly promoting unpasteurized milk, even though raw dairy contains bacterial pathogens and is 840 times more likely to cause illness and 45 times more likely to lead to hospitalization. Ironically, pasteurization—the heating of cow’s milk to kill pathogens—is one of the earliest public health breakthroughs from germ theory and was instrumental in giving children safe access to nutrition in the early 20th century.

As with many conspiracy theories, germ denial does contain kernels of truth. Microbes do not explain every health problem. Individual health does increase vulnerability to microbes. Environmental agents do harm health and do deserve substantially more research and regulation than they currently receive. Solving complex problems such as human disease, however, means researching and acting on both pathogens and pollutants, not abandoning proven life-saving behaviors and technologies.

## Are Scientists Studying Infectious Diseases Because of Greed and Control?

Some Germ Deniers argue that scientists are simply profiteers. They build on anti-vaccine rhetoric about the profit motive of “Big Pharma” and apply it to anyone researching, preventing, and treating infectious diseases.

In 2023, for example, then-candidate Donald Trump said: “They want you to be afraid. They want to jab your kids with poisons so they can make billions.”

Statements like this tap into real frustration about health costs and inequities, but they also promote distrust in all scientific inquiry and the scientists conducting it. While scientists earn salaries and sometimes profit from discoveries, so do professionals in every sector of society. Ironically, many Germ Deniers promote their own supplements for profit, even though those supplements often lack data on safety and effectiveness.

## Are Infectious Disease Researchers Recklessly Causing Outbreaks?

Paradoxically, the same people who downplay germs often insist that scientists are responsible for dangerous outbreaks of those germs. They argue that laboratory experiments—like gain-of-function research—have unleashed pathogens like SARS-CoV-2 or HIV into the world either accidentally or deliberately.

These concerns are not limited to fringe groups. Members of Congress have echoed them, leading to calls for moratoriums on federal virology research.

While lab safety is vital—I worked on this globally during my career with CDC—almost every infectious disease researcher I know is a problem solver, not problem creator, and primarily motivated by a desire to advance knowledge by preventing harm.

## How Do We Shift the Narrative Back to Science?

Writer Naomi Klein has observed that conspiracy theories “get the facts wrong but often get the feelings right.” Many people feel ignored by the healthcare system, overwhelmed by modern life, and mistrustful of those in power. If we want to counter the Germ Deniers, we must acknowledge those feelings and seek to address those important problems, while standing firm on facts.

I am deeply concerned that science and scientists are not just being devalued but also demonized. In future posts, I’ll share ways to recognize this movement better and steps health professionals and citizens can take to rebuild trust, defend science, and promote a healthier, more informed society.
