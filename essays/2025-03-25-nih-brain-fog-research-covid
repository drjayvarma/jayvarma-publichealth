## Key Points

* Brain fog is a major symptom of long COVID, affecting memory, focus, and mental processing.
* Studies link brain fog to neuroinflammation, blood-brain barrier damage, and neurotransmitter changes.
* Other infections like influenza, West Nile virus, and HIV also cause post-viral cognitive dysfunction.

Just a few months into the new U.S. president’s term, major changes are occurring in how the government’s main biomedical research agency, the National Institutes of Health (NIH), allocates funding.

I am hoping that, as the single biggest funder of long COVID research, NIH continues to fund at least one critical area: “brain fog,” a debilitating symptom of long COVID and other infectious diseases. Here's why.

## What Is Brain Fog?

“Brain fog” is not a formal medical diagnosis. Rather, it is a term widely used by researchers, patients, and the media to describe a combination of symptoms, including the following:

* Difficulty concentrating or maintaining attention
* Memory lapses and forgetfulness
* Slower processing speed
* Mental fatigue
* Trouble multitasking
* Trouble following conversations

People with brain fog often describe feeling like they are in a haze, their thinking sluggish or disorganized. Studies have shown measurable changes in cognitive performance in patients experiencing these symptoms.

Currently, there is no single test for brain fog. Healthcare providers diagnose the condition and researchers classify cases using the symptoms that patients report, neurocognitive assessments, and functional MRI to detect changes in brain activity.

The only treatments currently available include symptom management through cognitive rehabilitation, physical exercise, sleep optimization, and medications that target specific deficits like fatigue or attention problems.

## The Link Between COVID-19 and Brain Fog

As of September 2024, an estimated 17.9 million Americans likely had long COVID, and symptoms are thought to last for months to years. The risk is highest in people in whom the acute infection is most severe.

Brain fog is one of the most common and debilitating symptoms of long COVID. Individuals with long COVID are more likely to show deficits in memory, attention, and processing speed, even in cases where the initial infection was mild. Brain fog can also significantly impact daily life, limiting a person’s ability to work, study, or engage in social activities. COVID-19 vaccines have been shown in high-quality studies done both in the United States and other countries to reduce the likelihood of developing brain fog and long COVID.

## What Causes Brain Fog in COVID-19?

The leading theory for COVID-19-related brain fog is neuroinflammation—an immune response in the brain triggered by viral infection. Researchers believe that there are a few possible mechanisms for how the virus damages brain cells:

* **Triggering chronic inflammation:** Even after the virus is cleared from the body, the immune system remains active, leading to prolonged inflammation that disrupts neural function.
* **Damaging the blood-brain barrier:** The virus or the body’s immune response may make the protective barrier between the bloodstream and the brain more permeable, allowing harmful molecules to enter and cause cognitive dysfunction.
* **Altering neurotransmitters:** Some studies suggest changes in dopamine and serotonin signaling.

## Do Other Viral Infections Cause Brain Fog?

While COVID-19 has brought more attention and research into brain fog, a similar syndrome occurs with other infectious diseases. Infection with H1N1 influenza was observed to cause cognitive impairment similar to those seen in COVID-19, including brain fog. Many other respiratory viruses can also cause central nervous system problems.

West Nile virus and other viral causes of encephalitis cause direct infection of the brain, leaving some survivors with long-term depression, memory loss, and motor dysfunction. Even with effective antiretroviral therapy, up to 40 percent of HIV-infected people develop cognitive impairment, likely due to chronic inflammation and persistent low-level viral activity in the brain.

Brain fog has also been reported following Epstein-Barr virus (which causes mononucleosis), Lyme disease, and even some cases of dengue fever. The common thread is believed to immune system activation and inflammation that persist long after the acute infection has resolved.

## Why We Need to Keep Researching Long COVID Brain Fog

There are two main reasons I hope that NIH continues to fund research into long COVID.

First, COVID-19 is now a regular part of our seasonal virus landscape, which means that more people will continue to develop this debilitating condition.

Second, understanding brain fog from COVID-19 infection will help us understand all the other ways in which viruses cause inflammation in the brain, potentially giving us treatment for those conditions or related neurologic conditions that are associated with inflammation.

Here are some key questions that we still do not have complete answers to:

* **What are the precise biological mechanisms?** Understanding whether persistent inflammation, microvascular damage, or viral remnants in the brain drive brain fog could help identify new treatment targets.
* **Who is most at risk?** Some people’s cognitive symptoms resolve quickly, while others suffer for years. Research is needed to identify genetic, immunological, environmental, or lifestyle factors that influence recovery.
* **How can we diagnose brain fog objectively?** Current diagnostic methods rely heavily on self-reporting. Developing reliable biomarkers—tests of blood or other bodily fluids—could help with diagnosis and understanding which treatments are effective.
* **What treatments work?** Current approaches focus on symptom management, but few interventions target the underlying cause. Clinical trials are needed to test a wide range of interventions—anti-inflammatory drugs, neuroprotective agents, and cognitive rehabilitation strategies—in different populations.

## Why Continued NIH Funding Matters

Past research on post-viral syndromes, such as chronic fatigue syndrome, has often been dismissed or underfunded until overwhelming evidence forced action. The COVID-19 pandemic has given scientists an unprecedented opportunity to study this problem. If we stop this work now, we risk missing an opportunity to help people who are suffering now and people who will suffer in the future.
