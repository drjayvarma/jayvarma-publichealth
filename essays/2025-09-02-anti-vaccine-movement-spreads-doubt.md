## Key Points

* Germ denial and wellness influencers are used to downplay the threat of infectious diseases.
* Social media arguments help anti-vaxxers by amplifying their reach and boosting engagement.
* Offline conversations and personal stories are more effective in promoting vaccine trust.

The recent departure of high-level Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) officials has brought vaccine policy back into national headlines. Combined with the resurgence this year of measles and whooping cough—contagious, dangerous, and vaccine-preventable—prompted me to return to a report released five years ago about how to promote vaccines and counter misinformation.

In December 2020, the Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCHD), a British-American nonprofit, released a comprehensive report titled “The Anti-Vaxx Playbook,” which drew on information obtained from private conferences of anti-vaccine advocates. The report described how anti-vaccine advocates specifically saw the COVID-19 pandemic as a path to convincing people to oppose all childhood and adult vaccines.

Looking back, that report has important lessons for how all of us, whether we are health practitioners or patients, can promote vaccines and other proven health interventions.

## What Are the Pillars of the Anti-Vaccine Strategy?

In its report, CCHD distilled the anti-vaccine strategy down to three pillars. While the report focused on COVID-19, it’s clear that the strategy applies to almost all infectious diseases for which there are vaccines. The strategy is to convince people:

1. COVID-19, measles, whooping cough, and other infections are not dangerous.
2. Vaccines are dangerous.
3. Vaccine advocates cannot be trusted.

To convince people that infections are not dangerous, anti-vaccine advocates make arguments that align with the increasingly powerful “germ denier” movement. Germ deniers believe that bacteria, viruses, and other microorganisms only make people sick when people have something else deeply wrong with their bodies. They say that instead of vaccinating people to prevent illness and death from germs, the government should allow healthy people to be infected, and, for people with “something else deeply wrong with their bodies,” offer interventions, ideally those delivered by wellness influencers and not by conventional healthcare providers.

For the other two pillars of the strategy, anti-vaccine advocates make arguments that have been around since the discovery of vaccines. They amplify every potential harm from vaccines (no matter how rare), argue that every ingredient in them is dangerous, and suggest that vaccine advocates are motivated by the money they will earn and the control they will exert over others.

Anti-vaccine advocates specifically create “answering spaces” where people who have questions about vaccines can be redirected to companies and healthcare providers that offer to “boost their immunity” without vaccines and to treat whatever medical conditions they have with approaches the healthcare industry is supposedly hiding from them to maintain its profits.

## What Can Doctors Do to Promote Vaccines?

For healthcare providers, the report has one simple message: Use your voice everywhere you can. The authors emphasize the importance of being vocal about the benefits of vaccines in your office, in your social circle, in your community, and on social media.

It’s particularly important, they argue, to tell the stories of patients who became sick from vaccine-preventable infections (while preserving patient confidentiality, of course). Learn about and tell the stories of the scientists who developed vaccines to help counter the message that these were developed for greed or social control. And tell your personal story of why you and your family members chose to be vaccinated.

## What Can You Do to Promote Vaccines?

The report emphasizes that everyone who cares about vaccines can influence their community. Emphasize why you believe in vaccines and how vaccines help keep you and your family healthy. If you or a family member has a condition that places them at higher risk of infectious disease complications, such as cancer or advanced age, emphasize why other people’s decisions to vaccinate can help keep your loved one alive.

With social media, avoid arguing with trolls and trying to get into online debates. “Fact-checking” online, paradoxically, spreads misinformation more than facts. When you try to post facts in the comments section of an anti-vaccine advocate post, the back-and-forth on social media rarely convinces anyone. What it does do is tell the platform’s algorithm, “Wow, this post is interesting to people,” and, therefore, pushes it proactively to other people to see. As a result, the anti-vaccine message spreads further.

The next time you see a friend post an anti-vaccine argument, address it offline through a private personal message. I have personal experience with this approach from just a few weeks ago. A friend re-posted a story on Instagram from an anti-vaccine advocate about thimerosal, an ingredient used to keep some vaccines free from bacterial contamination. My friend and I exchanged a series of private messages over the next several days, where I explained my position, supplied him with high-quality research studies, and listened to his position. I successfully convinced him why the post was inaccurate, and he decided to take it down.

## Become a Successful Messenger for Public Health

Our public health is now at risk because of a coordinated strategy to confuse people, discredit experts, and profit from doubt about vaccines and infectious diseases. Each of us can be a successful messenger for public health by sharing our stories and choosing not to amplify the messages of anti-vaccine advocates.
