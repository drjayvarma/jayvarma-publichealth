## Measles is one of the most contagious diseases, spreading through the air by people who don’t yet have symptoms

When I first trained as an epidemiologist at CDC in 2001, I learned something surprising that I still find myself explaining regularly to people today. It’s not the most deadly diseases that cause the most chaos in our world. It’s the diseases that spread quickly and easily.

During the peak of COVID-19, people opposed to masks, vaccines, and other public health measures had a standard line. “Don’t worry about the virus, because it only kills a few people out of a thousand” or “your risk of dying is super low.” Sure, if you were in charge of a city that only had only 1 person living in it, then they were right: you did not have to worry about COVID-19.

But what if your city had 1 million people in it? That meant 1000 people might die when a COVID-19 wave swept through. When deciding how to protect a large population, a small percentage multiplied by a really big number is a big number.

In high-income settings, like the US, measles is estimated to kill about 1 in 1000 people who get infected. Why do we worry so much about measles then? Because it is one of the most contagious diseases known to man.

If you ask an expert to talk about what makes a virus contagious, they can talk to you for hours about all of the different aspects of a virus that might make it more contagious than another virus — how its molecules are structured and how they interact with the human body. But, from a public health perspective, there are two questions I always think about first when assessing how contagious an infectious disease is.

1. Can a person spread the infection without having any symptoms?
2. Can it spread through the air?

## Can infected people spread the infection even if they don’t have symptoms?

One of the reasons COVID-19 spread so quickly around the world and could not be contained is because people without symptoms could infect other people. You could think you were healthy and still be making other people sick.

In the first year of the pandemic, when no one had any pre-existing immunity to the virus, a person would be exposed to COVID-19, the virus would replicate in their nose and throat, and then a few days later, the person’s immune system would start fighting back against the virus, causing symptoms. During that lag between initial infection and the first onset of symptoms, people could easily spread the virus to other people.

This is also why SARS and MERS — which are coronaviruses similar to COVID-19 — do not continue to cause worldwide epidemics. With both of those viruses, most infections are spread by people who have symptoms. The people most infectious to other people know they are sick, and, therefore, are more likely to be in bed at home than spreading the virus in restaurants or at the gym.

Consider why HIV became such a devastating global epidemic. One of the many reasons is a person can be infected with HIV and not feel ill for 8–10 years. During that time, people with HIV infection can spread it through sex to multiple other people. When it was finally recognized as a disease caused by a virus in the 1980s, tens of thousands of people were probably already infected around the world.

## Measles spreads before you have symptoms

Measles can be spread by unvaccinated people who do not yet have symptoms, because the virus has an incubation period of about 10 days. That means, after a person has been exposed to measles, the virus replicates inside the body for about 10 days (in rare instances, for up to 18 days) before it causes any symptoms.

After this incubation period, a person develops a classic combination of symptoms, including fever, cough, nasal congestion, and/or conjunctivitis. A few days later, a full body rash appears. A person can spread the infection for up to four days before the rash appears — a period when they may have no or minimal symptoms — and for up to four days after.

## Do infected people spread infection through the air?

The second important question to consider for contagiousness is whether the infection spreads through the air. Most infectious diseases have multiple ways of spreading from one person to another. For example, they could spread it by directly touching another person, by having their blood or sexual fluids contact another person, or by contaminating food, water, or surfaces that they share with another person.

But the diseases that spread the fastest are those that are spread through the air. One of the most contentious scientific fights during COVID-19 — and a mistake that delayed effective response to the pandemic — was whether most COVID-19 infections were being spread through the air over a long-range vs. whether they required close contact vs. whether they were being transmitted by physical surfaces.

Intensive research and prolonged advocacy by environmental health experts eventually convinced public health officials (including, unfortunately, myself) that COVID-19 was often spread through the air over a long-range. A person would breathe out viral particles, those viral particles would float through the air, and they could infect people across an entire room.

Indeed, this is why one of the leading infectious diseases killers of man over the past thousand years has been tuberculosis (TB). TB is a special type of bacterial infection that can be spread through the air. A patient who is coughing, talking, or singing breathes the bacteria out into the air, it floats across a room and can potentially infect anyone in that room. In fact, a lot of the original science on airborne transmission of infectious disease was done on TB.

It also explains why Ebola, even though highly lethal, has not caused widespread outbreaks outside of Africa. To get infected with Ebola virus, you need to have direct physical contact with someone who is infected and — this is important — who also has severe symptoms from the infection. In the epidemics that have occurred in Africa, most infections are transmitted in hospitals, at funerals (where people physically touch a dead body as part of religious services), or at home during childbirth.

## Measles spreads through the air

Measles is caused by a virus that spreads primarily through the air. Its extraordinary contagiousness is due to unique biological properties of the virus. When an infected person coughs, sneezes, or simply exhales, they shed the virus in respiratory particles as small as 1–5 micrometers — about 1/50th the width of a human hair. Unlike many respiratory viruses that deteriorate rapidly in the air, the measles virus is able to remain stable in these particles. The virus has a special protein coat that resists environmental stress and drying out.

These particles are so tiny that they behave like a gas. What this means is that they follow the air currents throughout a room rather than falling to the ground. When the particles flow with the air, they can readily fly into the nose or mouth of another person. Once these particles enter the upper airways, the virus targets specific immune cells in their airways called dendritic cells and alveolar macrophages. The virus then hijacks these cells’ normal function, using them as vehicles to spread throughout the body and cause a whole body infection.

Studies also show that the virus can remain infectious in the air for up to two hours after a person with measles leaves a space. This “airborne persistence” is one reason why shared indoor environments, such as schools and childcare centers, are particularly vulnerable during outbreaks.

(Measles also has a third property that makes it particularly contagious. It has an “infectious dose” that is extremely low.” As few as 10 viral particles may be enough to cause infection — far fewer than needed for other respiratory viruses.)

This combination of asymptomatic spread, stable viral particles, efficient spread through the air, and extremely low infectious dose explains why one child with measles in a classroom can easily infect 90% of unvaccinated classmates without anyone knowing it until more than a week later.

To appreciate how dangerous the virus can be to a community, consider the basic reproduction number (R0) of measles — the average number of people one infected person will transmit the virus to in a fully susceptible population. Estimates of measles’ R0 range from 12 to 18, making it significantly more contagious than influenza or COVID-19. Because of this exceptional transmissibility, even a small decrease in vaccination rates makes a community susceptible to large outbreaks.

## The first line of defense against measles: vaccination

Vaccination remains the most effective way to prevent measles. The measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine provides long-lasting immunity.
