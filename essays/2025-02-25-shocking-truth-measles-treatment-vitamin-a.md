When measles spreads through communities, public health agencies stop transmission by vaccinating anyone at risk of measles, such as close contacts of a measles case and the contacts-of-contacts. They also try to identify anyone suspected of being sick with measles and isolating them until they are no longer infectious. But how do we treat patients who have measles, other than just isolating them from spreading it to other people? It may shock you, but, for a disease this devastating, we don’t have much beyond thoughts and prayers. There are no approved drugs for measles, and the one treatment we do have only offers minimal benefit.

## How Does Measles Attack the Body?

The measles virus initially invades the body through the nose and throat, infecting specialized immune cells called dendritic cells. These infected cells then act as vehicles, transporting the virus into the lungs and throughout the body.

In the lungs, the virus triggers severe inflammation, destroying the protective cells that line the airways and causing symptoms of bronchitis and pneumonia. The damage to these tissues makes patients with measles susceptible to a second infection: bacterial pneumonia, which is the main cause for many measles-related deaths.

## Measles suppresses the immune system for years

The risk of dying from an additional infection is not just during the acute sickness phase. The risk can last for years. The measles virus replicates aggressively, leading to widespread inflammation and suppression of the immune system — a phenomenon now known as “immune amnesia.” Patients who have had measles essentially have their immune system wiped out and need to restore it, just as if they were infants newly exposed to life outside the womb. They may require repeat doses of vaccines they previously received and should be evaluated carefully whenever they develop signs of illness.

## Why Young Children Face the Greatest Risk

Infants and young children under five bear the heaviest burden of measles illness and deaths. Their developing immune systems, smaller airways, and incomplete vaccination status create a perfect storm for severe disease.

The virus can trigger acute encephalitis (brain inflammation) in approximately 1 in 1,000 cases, potentially leading to permanent brain damage or death. Even more devastating is subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE), a rare fatal complication that can emerge years after infection.

In addition to the risk to children, pregnant women who become infected are at increased risk of losing their babies in the womb and of dying themselves.

## Why Don’t We Have Anti-Measles Drugs?

The remarkable success of measles vaccines has paradoxically left us with no drugs to treat people who end up sick with measles. The modern age of drug development began in the 1960s, the same decade in which the first measles vaccine was developed.

At that time, it appeared that a single dose of vaccine, administered to young children, was almost 100% protective for life against measles. As measles incidence dropped and people were no longer ‘boosted’ by being exposed to measles cases in the community, public health guidance changed to recommend a second dose of vaccine.

With prevention so effective and inexpensive, pharmaceutical companies and governments had no incentive to develop drugs to treat people with measles infection or other common viruses that had effective vaccines, such as mumps and rubella.

However, even with adequate funding and scientific interest, developing effective anti-viral drugs against measles is challenging. The virus’s rapid replication and spread mean that any treatment needs to be given very early in the course of infection, often before symptoms appear. (As I discussed in a previous post, a person may be infected with measles and have no symptoms for 1–2 weeks, and the first few days of symptoms often resemble the common cold.)

Another challenge with developing a drug against measles is that it is an RNA virus. These viruses can quickly develop resistance to antivirals, potentially requiring treatment with more than one drug.

Clinical trials of antiviral drugs have shown limited success. Ribavirin, a broad-spectrum antiviral, has been tested in severe cases, but results have not been consistent and the benefit not large. More recent attempts with newer antivirals have stalled during development, because they were not safe or effective.

## Can Vitamin A save people infected with measles?

Without a drug to treat measles, the only medication we are left with is vitamin A. This essential nutrient plays a crucial role in maintaining the lining of airways and supporting immune function. During measles infection, vitamin A levels often plummet, increasing the risk of complications.

The evidence supporting vitamin A supplementation in measles treatment comes from multiple clinical trials and other studies. A meta-analysis of eight randomized controlled trials showed that vitamin A supplementation reduced measles mortality by 60% in children less than two years old. The World Health Organization recommends two doses of vitamin A for all children with measles in developing countries, where vitamin A deficiency is common.

The vitamin A used for treatment is different than what’s available in drug stores as a vitamin A supplement. In severe measles cases, the recommended dosing is substantially higher: 200,000 IU for children over 12 months (100,000 IU for younger infants), given immediately upon diagnosis and repeated the next day. This high-dose regimen requires careful administration and monitoring by a healthcare provider, as vitamin A can be toxic at excessive levels.

## What options are left for kids with measles?

For clinicians managing measles cases today, the focus must be on diagnosing measles as quickly as possible, adminstering Vitamin A at the correct dosage if indicated and carefully monitored by a health professional, and providing proper nutrition, hydration, and treatment for pneumonia and other potential complications. In young children with pneumonia, many require admission to an intensive care unit and, potentially, breathing support with a mechanical ventilator.

## A Post-Elimination Era in the US?

While the most effective approach to measles remains prevention through vaccination, I fear we are entering a new post-elimination era in the US and will, in a few years, see tens of thousands of cases annually.

The US declared measles eliminated as a public health threat in 2000, meaning that any cases of measles were caused by an American who got infected while traveling outside the US. But the anti-vaccine movement has spread lies about vaccines that have now taken hold, and the most famous anti-vaccine spokesperson in the US (Robert F. Kennedy, Jr.) now oversees the national vaccine program for children and the public health agencies responsible for measles prevention (CDC) and research (NIH).

Will pharmaceutical companies develop new treatments? Unfortunately, I think the future for further infectious disease research on treatments is similarly bleak, given the statements that Kennedy has made about moving “beyond infectious diseases” and efforts by the current administration to reduce medical research funding.

Without effective treatments available, Americans will soon see how dangerous this disease is — measured in infants severely ill, disabled, and dying, as well as women losing their babies during pregnancy — and will re-learn why the US was, for so long, such a leader in promoting measles vaccination both here and around the world.
