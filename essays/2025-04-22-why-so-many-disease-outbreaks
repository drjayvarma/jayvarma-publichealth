## Key Points

* Climate change drives new outbreaks by altering where people, animals, and insects can live.
* Livestock production and global meat trade accelerate the emergence of new superbugs.
* Staying informed and vaccinated reduces your risk in a new era of pandemics.

Bird flu in America. Marburg virus in Africa. Warnings about “Disease X.” These headlines are unsettling, but, for those of us who study infectious diseases, they have become the new normal.

We live in a new age of pandemics with newly emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases. Understanding why this is happening can help us stay safe and sane.

## Are There More Outbreaks Now?

Over the past two decades, the number of outbreaks reported around the world has grown significantly. Part of this is good news: Advances in lab technology and global reporting systems mean we detect threats faster than ever. But better detection alone doesn’t explain the surge.

Think of it like a soccer game: Viruses and bacteria are playing offense, and the rest of us are playing defense. Unfortunately, their offense is evolving faster than our defense.

Here are **five reasons** why outbreaks are becoming more common—and why old threats are reappearing.

## 1. Human Encroachment on Nature Sparks New Diseases

As humans push into forests and jungles, we come into closer contact with wildlife. Most viruses that threaten humans—HIV, Ebola, COVID-19—originated in animals. The “spillover” happens where humans, animals, and insects intersect.

Sometimes transmission is direct (e.g., HIV). Other times, insects carry infections from animals to people, as with Lyme disease or dengue.

## 2. Factory Farming Increases Risk of “Superbugs”

As demand for meat rises globally, more animals are raised in crowded conditions. These farms—and the slaughterhouses and markets they feed—are breeding grounds for infection.

Routine antibiotic use in livestock fuels **antimicrobial resistance**, creating drug-resistant “superbugs” that can spread to humans.

---

## 3. Rapid Urbanization Spreads Infections Faster

Cities now host millions in dense environments—37 “megacities” worldwide have more than 10 million residents.

Urban crowding allows a virus that might once have burned out in a rural setting to spread rapidly. The scale of urbanization multiplies risk.

---

## 4. Global Travel Accelerates Spread

Air travel connects billions of people within hours. Cities with major airports—like New York—are often the first hit in new outbreaks.

This pattern held true for Zika, COVID-19, and mpox. What happens locally no longer stays local.

---

## 5. Climate Change Increases Outbreak Risk

Rising temperatures, shifting rain patterns, and extreme weather reshape ecosystems.

* Mosquitoes carrying dengue or malaria now thrive in parts of the U.S.
* Droughts and floods displace people, fueling outbreaks in crowded shelters.
* Climate change amplifies every other risk factor, creating a cascade of vulnerabilities.

---

## How to Protect Yourself and Your Family

* **Stay up to date on vaccines.** Measles, mpox, and RSV vaccines are especially important now.
* **Manage chronic health risks.** Conditions like diabetes increase susceptibility to infection.
* **Stay informed.** Use credible sources to reduce anxiety and prepare rationally.
* **Support public health.** Strong systems protect everyone, regardless of borders or politics.

## Living Safely in the Age of Pandemics

We can’t return to the pre-COVID world—just as airport security never went back to pre-9/11 norms. But we can adapt.

By **reducing vulnerability** (vaccination, healthier lifestyles, strong health systems) and **building resilience** (community support, informed responses), we can live safely in a world where outbreaks are inevitable but catastrophic pandemics don’t have to be.
