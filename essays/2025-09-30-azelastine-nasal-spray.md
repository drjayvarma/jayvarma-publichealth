## Key Points

* Viruses like COVID-19 and rhinovirus usually enter the body through the nose.
* Azelastine nasal spray reduced COVID-19 cases in a randomized trial.
* The trial was small, industry-funded, and involved young, healthy adults.
* Larger multi-center studies must confirm the benefits before broad use.

Every winter, I prepare for my clinic schedule to fill up with patients experiencing runny noses, coughs, and fevers caused by viruses, such as rhinoviruses, influenza, and COVID-19. I also prepare that I'll get sick myself at least once, no matter how cautious I am. While vaccines, handwashing, and high-quality face masks are beneficial, I have always wondered why we cannot yet block respiratory viruses at the place where they enter the body: the nose.

A new clinical trial from Germany suggests that an over-the-counter nasal spray, already sold for allergies, may reduce the risk of being infected with COVID-19 and common cold viruses. Let's review what the study showed and how best to act on its results.

## Why Does the Nose Matter for Winter Virus Season?

Respiratory viruses float through the air and land first on the internal lining of the nose. From there, they attach to and invade the cells in our nose, leading to inflammation. That inflammation produces symptoms, such as congestion, runny nose, sore throat, and, in some of us, fever, chills, and body aches. In theory, if you can reduce the ability of a virus to attach and replicate in the nose, you could stop infection altogether.

This is the scientific rationale for studying nasal sprays, lozenges, or other topical agents. Researchers have tried many substances in the past, such as iodine, carrageenan, and nitric oxide, with mixed results.

## Could Azelastine Prevent COVID and Colds?

Azelastine is an antihistamine used for decades to treat allergic rhinitis. Studies done in laboratories show it also interferes with multiple steps of viral infection.

From 2023 to 2024, German researchers enrolled 450 healthy volunteers between 18 and 65 years of age. They randomly assigned them to use azelastine 0.1% nasal spray or a placebo nasal spray three times each day for 56 days. Most were young and healthy, and nearly all had previously been vaccinated against COVID-19.

Over the two-month study, 2.2 percent of the azelastine group developed laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 compared with 6.7 percent in the placebo group. People who used azelastine had fewer symptomatic illnesses, and, if they became infected, developed it later in the study, suggesting some protection against viral infection. The spray also appeared to reduce laboratory-confirmed rhinovirus infections, the leading cause of the common cold.

Overall rates of adverse events were similar in both groups, but three symptoms were more common in the people who took azelastine: bitter taste, nosebleeds, and fatigue. In my experience, many people report fatigue because, similar to other antihistamines, azelastine can have a sedative-like effect.

## What Were the Limitations of the Azelastine Study?

Here are a few reasons why we need to be cautious about this study.

* The study was conducted at a single hospital in Germany. Weâ€™re not sure whether these findings would be replicated if studied in a larger and different population.
* Participants were young, healthy, and mostly vaccinated. They were not the older adults or people with multiple medical conditions who are at highest risk of complications from COVID-19 and need the most protection.
* The number of infections overall was small. This means that the findings, though statistically significant, could change if a larger population was studied.
* The trial was funded by the manufacturer. This means that it is more prone to bias in how it was designed and reported.

## Should I Use a Nasal Spray to Prevent Colds?

I am really excited to see studies like this that focus on trying to block viruses from causing illness when they enter the nose and upper airway. We already have one nasal flu vaccine that is approved for use, and many other nasal vaccines are being studied as well.

That said, our first line of defense should be the things that have already been proven to be beneficial. If you want to avoid getting sick during winter respiratory virus season, start first with vaccination. I recommend that children and adults get vaccinated against flu and COVID-19 every winter, which is what major medical societies in the U.S. recommend as well. Second, improve indoor air quality in your homes and workspaces through portable air purifiers. Third, consider using a well-fitting, high-quality N95 or KN95 in higher-risk situations, such as airplanes, hospitals, and crowded public areas.

We need larger, multi-center studies of azelastine and similar agents to confirm these early findings before we recommend them broadly to everyone. For those already using azelastine for allergies, continue doing so since there may be an added benefit against viruses. For those not using it already, azelastine appears safe and could be considered as an added layer of defense, while we wait for more definitive studies.
