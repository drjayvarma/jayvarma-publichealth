### Key points

* Breathwork can support mental health and overall well-being.
* Breathwork can reduce stress and alter inflammatory markers.
* Immune changes from breathing are short-term, modest, and of unclear significance. ([Psychology Today][1])

Over the past year, I started practicing breathwork to help with my mental health. Slowing my breath and breathing deep into my diaphragm has helped bring me calm and perspective, and longer sessions have helped me work through negative thought patterns. Breathwork, I have found, is an important adjunct to other components of a healthy life, such as nutrition, physical exercise, sleep, and social connection. ([Psychology Today][1])

I recently began to wonder whether breathwork can also help protect against infectious diseases, the area I spend much of my life working on. The theoretical argument is that breathing affects the nervous system and psychological well-being, both of which can impact immunity. Moreover, breathwork is accessible, inexpensive, and safe, and many people already accept it as a tool for mental health. ([Psychology Today][1])

## What is breathwork?

Breathwork is considered a deliberate attempt to alter the depth, pace, or pattern of breathing to influence your physiological and psychological state. It can involve slow diaphragmatic breathing, rhythmic breathing, and/or periods of breath retention. ([Psychology Today][1])

Across continents and throughout recorded history, indigenous healers and major religions have used breathing as a tool to influence the mind and body. Some examples include yogic pranayama, meditative breathing in Buddhist and Daoist practice, and chanting and contemplative prayer in Christian and Islamic services. In the United States, breathwork emerged in the 1960s and 1970s as a larger movement when mental health professionals and others began exploring how changes in breathing could help people regulate their emotions, process difficult experiences, and improve their overall sense of well-being. ([Psychology Today][1])

## How does the immune system respond to breathwork?

Several randomized trials and systematic reviews have examined the body’s physiologic response to breathwork. The most consistent finding is that breathwork changes chemical markers of inflammation. Slow-paced breathing, diaphragmatic breathing, and rhythmic breathing activate the parasympathetic nervous system and appear to lower levels of immune system chemicals involved in inflammation during infections and chronic stress. ([Psychology Today][1])

Some studies suggest that breathwork training may influence levels of immune-related activity, such as natural killer (NK) cell function, and reduce inflammatory markers in specific settings. These findings suggest that deliberate changes in breathing can shift the balance of pro- and anti-inflammatory activity in the short term. ([Psychology Today][1])

However, the strongest and most consistent evidence for breathwork relates to stress reduction. Systematic reviews highlight that breathwork reliably reduces stress and cortisol levels, which may indirectly support immune function by mitigating stress-induced immunosuppression. High cortisol levels over prolonged periods can suppress many parts of immune function. ([Psychology Today][1])

It’s important to recognize that these studies **do not prove** that breathwork actually prevents infections. They simply provide a scientific rationale to believe it is plausible that breathwork may influence some components of immune activity in the short term. ([Psychology Today][1])

## How breathwork helps people with chronic respiratory disease

Breathwork has more robust evidence in another area that intersects with immunity. People with chronic respiratory diseases — such as COPD, asthma, interstitial lung disease, lung cancer, and post-COVID syndromes — frequently feel distress from breathlessness, and these conditions make patients more susceptible to pneumonia and other infections. ([Psychology Today][1])

Across many randomized trials and systematic reviews, breathing exercises have been shown to help people walk farther and tolerate exertion better, improving their quality of life and reducing the sensation of breathlessness. These improvements often last for months. However, in these patients, breathwork **has not been proven to reduce infection rates or slow disease progression**. ([Psychology Today][1])

## What is the evidence for breathwork’s impact on infectious diseases?

My summary of the scientific evidence for breathwork and infectious diseases is:

* It is scientifically plausible that breathwork can improve immunity, possibly through pathways involving stress reduction.
* There is currently no high-quality evidence that breathwork prevents illness, reduces illness severity, or promotes recovery from infectious diseases.
* Because infections are a major cause of illness and death, and breathwork is cheap and simple for people to practice, we need researchers to study this question in large randomized clinical trials. ([Psychology Today][1])

I recommend people consider breathwork to help their overall sense of wellbeing and mental health, but, for preventing respiratory infections, I recommend sticking to what we know works best: get vaccinated annually against flu and COVID-19, wear a high-quality mask in crowded indoor spaces, and improve indoor air quality.
