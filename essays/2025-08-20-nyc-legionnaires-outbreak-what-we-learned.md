## What is Legionnaires’ disease?

Legionnaires’ disease is a severe form of pneumonia caused by *Legionella* bacteria. Infected people often develop symptoms of a respiratory infection, such as cough, fever, and shortness of breath, and can be cured with antibiotic treatment. Infection can be lethal, however, in people over 50 years old, smokers, and those with chronic illnesses. Many infected people are never diagnosed, because it requires clinicians to order special laboratory testing of respiratory specimens or urine for *Legionella*.
People with Legionnaires’ disease cannot spread it to other people.

## How are cooling towers linked to Legionnaires’ disease?

People get infected with *Legionella* by breathing in small droplets of water contaminated with the bacteria. These droplets most often come from devices that use water and generate a mist, such as hot tubs or improperly maintained plumbing systems in settings with vulnerable populations, including hospitals and nursing homes.
Another major source is cooling towers, which are usually placed on rooftops of large buildings. Air-conditioning systems generate waste heat, which is absorbed by water in the building’s cooling system. This heated water is pumped into the cooling tower and sprayed into the air. As some of the water evaporates, it carries heat away, creating a mist that is released into the environment.
*Legionella* bacteria can grow on the inside surfaces of pipes and tanks in the cooling tower. From there, these bacteria can be expelled into the air along with the mist and carried long distances, exposing thousands of people who walk on nearby streets or breathe the mist through windows. The only way to prevent *Legionella* growth and spread is to maintain and disinfect cooling towers consistently and correctly.

## 2015 South Bronx Legionnaires outbreak prompted legislation

By the time New York City detected the 2015 outbreak, dozens of people had been hospitalized. The investigation tested more than 50 cooling towers in the neighborhood. Two towers matched patient strains, but **whole-genome sequencing** confirmed a cooling tower atop a new hotel as the primary source. ([Healthbeat][1])

The outbreak was centered in one of New York’s poorest neighborhoods, where residents already suffered disproportionately from chronic illnesses that made them more vulnerable. In total, **138 people were sickened and 16 died**, making it the largest Legionnaires’ disease outbreak in city history and the second-largest ever reported in the United States. ([Healthbeat][1])

Before 2015, experts had long warned that cooling towers were a likely source of Legionnaires’ outbreaks. However, proving a specific source requires more than detecting *Legionella* in the environment — it requires matching DNA strains via methods like pulsed-field gel electrophoresis or whole-genome sequencing. ([Healthbeat][1])

In the wake of the 2015 outbreak, New York’s City Council passed legislation requiring:

* Every building with a cooling tower to **register** it with the Health Department
* **Quarterly testing** of those cooling towers
* **Remediation** if *Legionella* is detected
* Funding for Health Department inspectors to enforce compliance ([Healthbeat][1])

## Did New York City’s regulations for cooling towers work?

Within the first year of implementation, the Health Department inspected nearly 80% of cooling towers and forced remediation of contamination that might otherwise have gone undetected. ([Healthbeat][1])

While annual **Legionnaires’ disease cases have fluctuated**, no large outbreak occurred until 2025. ([Healthbeat][1])

During the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic, the city diverted resources to emergency response, and routine inspections dropped. Staffing at the City Health Department has not fully recovered. Reporters have documented that **the number of cooling tower inspections in 2025 is at its lowest level since the program began**. ([Healthbeat][1])

After the 2025 outbreak was identified, the Health Department reported that **11 cooling towers in the area tested positive** for *Legionella*. Of these, four are run by the city, and two are associated with health services (Harlem Hospital and a Health Department sexual health clinic). ([Healthbeat][1])

Although proving causation (i.e., that the regulation directly prevented outbreaks) is challenging, the evidence is suggestive:

* Maintaining *Legionella*-free cooling towers likely reduces bacterial spread
* Outbreaks were increasing before 2015, then declined after regulation
* After inspections declined in 2025, another lethal outbreak occurred ([Healthbeat][1])

## Infections may be inevitable, but outbreaks are a choice

The 2025 Legionnaires’ disease outbreak in New York City underscores that **regulations do not enforce themselves** — they require sustained investment in government personnel to ensure compliance. The COVID-19 pandemic prompted backlash against government authority, and austerity budgets have hampered public health agencies. While *Legionella* infections may occur, **outbreaks are preventable with consistent oversight and enforcement**. ([Healthbeat][1])
