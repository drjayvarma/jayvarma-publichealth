## Key Points

* Before you worry, ask whether the disease has been confirmed by lab testing.
* Respiratory diseases spread fastest—but not all viruses travel the same way.
* A disease’s severity matters less than how easily it spreads silently.
* Always ask whether doctors already have tools to diagnose, treat, or prevent it.

News of a strange illness in a faraway country. Reports of coughing, fevers, or unexplained deaths. Social media postings about the next pandemic. If you’ve felt a surge of anxiety when seeing such stories, you’re not alone.

As I discussed in a previous post, new diseases are emerging and spreading faster than ever. Social and mainstream media are capitalizing on that trend, however, and spreading speculation about potential outbreaks even when they have not been verified.

In early 2025, social media lit up with accounts of people in Russia coughing up blood from an unidentified cause. Late last year, the buzz centered on a so-called “Disease X” in Congo. And, before that, concern grew over a spike in respiratory illnesses among children in China.

Each time, the extent of coverage outweighed the extent of threat.

As a physician who has spent more than two decades working on disease outbreaks across the globe, I’ve come to recognize a pattern not just in how diseases spread but in how fear spreads with them. We all need to know how to think clearly when we hear about a possible outbreak—to know when to worry and when not to.

Here are four questions that public health experts ask when trying to assess risk:

* Has the cause actually been confirmed?
* How easily does it spread?
* How severe is the illness?
* What tools do we have to stop it?

Let’s unpack each one so you can ask the same questions the next time you hear about an outbreak.

## 1. Has the Cause Actually Been Confirmed?

One of the first lessons I learned at the CDC’s Epidemic Intelligence Service was this: “notbreaks” are more common than outbreaks. Not every cluster of illness is an outbreak, and not every outbreak is a cause for concern. Some clusters are just statistical noise or routine illnesses grouped by coincidence.

Early reports usually focus on symptoms that people are having, e.g., fever, cough, diarrhea, but not the cause. Unlike many medical conditions, infectious diseases can be verified by laboratory tests that indicate whether the patient has the illness or not, what the cause of the disease is, and what treatment is likely to cure it.

Testing is essential. Are samples being taken from the right places, e.g., the nose, lungs, blood, or urine? Are they being tested using the best available methods, like PCR (polymerase chain reaction), and in laboratories that meet quality standards? In many parts of the world, such systems are stretched thin.

Without high-quality laboratory tests on patients and confirmation that there is a common bacteria or virus causing the symptoms, the patients may have any of dozens of known diseases. Their illnesses may not even be related to each other.

In the Congo “Disease X” reports, nearly 900 people fell ill, and dozens died. But when international teams tested samples, they found a mix of causes and none were unusual: malaria, influenza, rhinoviruses, and COVID-19. "Disease X" was actually a failing healthcare system, and there was concern that illnesses and deaths were linked to a new disease, because people had not been adequately tested for routine diseases.

**Before you worry, ask: What do we actually know about the cause?**

## 2. How Easily Does It Spread?

The route of transmission matters a lot. There are five main ways infections spread:

* Through the air (like measles)
* By direct contact (like ringworm)
* Through contaminated food or water (like *Salmonella*)
* Through blood or other body fluids (like HIV)
* Through bites from insects (like malaria)

Airborne diseases are especially concerning because they move fast and silently. Someone who coughs or even breathes near you on a bus or plane can spread illness before anyone knows they are sick.

But not all respiratory viruses are the same. When human metapneumovirus (HMPV) cases rose in China, some speculated it might signal a new pandemic. In reality, HMPV is a well-known virus that has long circulated globally and peaks in different seasons.

Or consider mpox (previously known as monkeypox). When it first appeared in large numbers in 2022, there was fear it might spread easily through contact and through the air, like its sister virus smallpox. But most cases were linked to direct, close physical contact—primarily in specific sexual networks—not casual encounters or by breathing the air near an infected person.

**If you’re trying to understand your own risk, don’t just ask whether something is spreading. Ask how it’s spreading.**

## 3. How Severe Is the Illness?

This might seem like the most obvious question, but it is also the most misunderstood.

Diseases that cause very severe illness—and that do so quickly—can often be contained. That’s because the people affected are too sick to move around and are easy to identify and isolate. Ebola, for example, is deadly but has not caused widespread outbreaks in countries with strong healthcare systems. People who are most infectious are usually already in a hospital bed and isolated.

Contrast that with COVID-19. One important reason it spread so widely is that many people had no symptoms at all, or only mild ones, but could still infect others. Ironically, this very feature made it much more dangerous for the world, because infections that spread silently are much harder to detect and contain.

Of course, it is reasonable to worry when a disease kills people. But a better predictor of whether it will disrupt society is how easily those people can pass it on before anyone knows they’re sick.

## 4. What Tools Do We Have?

When COVID-19 emerged, we had no diagnostic tests, vaccines, or drugs. That made it particularly dangerous.

Today, when a new outbreak is reported, one of the most important things to ask is: Do we already have medicines, vaccines, and diagnostic tests?

Consider bird flu (H5N1). It’s been around for years and, so far, has primarily caused illness in animals, not humans. But public health experts remain concerned because existing flu vaccines don’t provide strong protection against it. If it ever spreads widely among people, we could be left scrambling again.

The good news is that every outbreak often leads to new tools we can use for the next one. HIV has been one of the deadliest infections of the past 100 years. Attempts to control it, however, led us to important discoveries that have helped with diagnosing, treating, and preventing many other infectious diseases. The challenge is making sure those tools are ready when we need them.

## How Do I Think Clearly When I Hear About an Outbreak?

We now live in a world where alerts move faster than infections (hence the phrase “going viral”). Understanding how professionals assess the threats can help all of us respond more calmly and constructively.

The next time a mysterious disease makes headlines, don’t just ask: “Could this be the next pandemic?”

Ask these four questions instead:

* Has the cause been confirmed?
* How does it spread?
* How severe is it?
* Do we have ways to prevent or treat it?
