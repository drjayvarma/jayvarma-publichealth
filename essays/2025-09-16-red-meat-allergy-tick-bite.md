## Key Points

* Alpha-gal syndrome is a delayed allergic reaction to red meat caused by tick bites.
* Symptoms may include hives, nausea, and even anaphylaxis hours after eating meat.
* Diagnosis is often delayed, and patients must avoid beef, pork, lamb, and even gelatin-containing products.

I remember the first time I heard about alpha-gal syndrome. It was more than 12 years ago, and I was out to dinner with friends, when one of them said, “Too bad I can’t order any of the steaks.” He went on to describe how, in the past year, he had noticed that every time he ate red meat, he developed itchy skin, nausea, and stomach pain a few hours later. What he was describing is now an epidemic in the United States and growing in other countries as well: alpha-gal syndrome (AGS).

## What Is Red Meat Allergy?

AGS is a food allergy triggered by a sugar molecule (galactose-alpha-1,3-galactose) that is found in all mammals except humans and other primates. When ticks bite a person's skin, they can introduce this molecule into the human bloodstream, stimulating allergic antibodies (IgE) that persist. In the future, any exposure to meat-derived products (e.g., beef, pork, lamb, or even gelatin in capsules) could cause an allergic reaction. These allergic reactions to meat products start a few hours after exposure and range from mild upset stomach to anaphylaxis.

Traditional food allergies are usually to proteins in food and cause a reaction almost immediately. In contrast, AGS is a reaction to a carbohydrate, and symptoms usually occur three to six hours after eating. This delayed onset explains why patients often spend years with symptoms and without an accurate diagnosis of AGS.

Since it was first documented in 2009, more than 110,000 suspected AGS cases have been recorded in the United States. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that the true number may, in fact, be three or four times that, making it one of the most common food allergies in the United States. Surveillance data from Martha’s Vineyard in Massachusetts, Long Island in New York, and North Carolina suggest rates are increasing sharply in areas where the ticks that transmit AGS are expanding their geographic reach.

## What Types of Ticks Spread Alpha-Gal Syndrome?

The type of tick to be worried about is the "lone star tick," officially known as *Amblyomma americanum*. The tick can be identified by a distinctive white spot on the back of adult females, and, unlike many other ticks, it is aggressive and highly mobile. Deer or dog ticks passively wait for a host, but lone star ticks actively crawl toward humans and animals after detecting carbon dioxide.

Once limited to the southeastern United States, the lone star tick has now spread as far north as Maine and as far west as Colorado. Climate change, land use changes, and the expansion of host animals like deer and turkeys have helped this tick spread to more areas of the country. On Martha’s Vineyard, for example, positive blood tests for alpha-gal jumped from just two in 2020 to more than 500 in 2024.

Lone star ticks appear to carry alpha-gal in all stages of their life cycle. That includes larval ticks, which are nearly invisible to the naked eye but can swarm a person by the hundreds. Unlike Lyme disease, which requires a blood meal from an infected animal to be transmitted to humans, alpha-gal syndrome can result from a single bite, even from a larva that has never taken a blood meal.

## What Are the Symptoms of Alpha-Gal Syndrome, and How Is It Diagnosed?

People with AGS usually experience rash, itching, hives, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, stomach cramps, and/or dizziness after consuming red meat or mammalian products. It’s been called “the midnight allergy” because people eat red meat at dinner, fall asleep, then develop symptoms in the middle of the night.

Many patients undergo extensive gastrointestinal or cardiac evaluations, repeated ER visits for unexplained allergic reactions, and unnecessary dietary restrictions before being accurately diagnosed. The most accurate test is a blood test for alpha-gal–specific IgE antibodies. It is not detectable using the standard skin prick test, which is used for other food allergies.

## Can Alpha-Gal Syndrome Be Treated, and How Do You Live With It?

There is no cure for AGS. Once people develop alpha-gal, they can continue eating chicken and fish but must avoid foods and products that contain the alpha-gal molecule, including beef, pork, lamb, venison, rabbit, and, in some cases, dairy and gelatin.

Patients must read labels carefully and ask detailed questions when dining out. Some patients even report symptoms from inhaling cooking fumes or from medications and supplements that contain gelatin.

To manage the allergy risk, AGS patients should carry antihistamines to use for mild reactions and epinephrine auto-injectors in case they are at risk of anaphylaxis.

The psychosocial impacts of AGS can be substantial. People often feel anxious about eating out, traveling, or attending social events involving food. They may grieve the loss of favorite foods or feel socially isolated. Relationships can be strained by the logistical and emotional burden of always being worried about exposure to a meat product. Some patients report depression or fear about future tick bites and worsening symptoms.

## How Do You Prevent Alpha-Gal Syndrome?

The only way to prevent AGS is to prevent tick bites. That means wearing long sleeves and pants when in tick habitats; treating shoes, clothes, and gear with permethrin; and using Environmental Protection Agency-registered insect repellents. After outdoor exposure to an area with ticks, people should try to shower within two hours and perform thorough tick checks.

Because alpha-gal may be transmitted by larval ticks that are nearly invisible, even people who don’t recall a tick bite may be at risk. Pets can also bring ticks into the home, so tick prevention for animals is important.

Some communities, such as those on Martha’s Vineyard, are experimenting with deer population control and habitat management to reduce the tick population.

## Why Preventing Tick Bites Is So Important

Alpha-gal syndrome is a reminder that our environment, animals, and immune systems all interact in complex ways to determine our health. As climate change increases the geographic range of tick species, we need to be extra-vigilant about avoiding tick bites and aware that we might get a red meat allergy from them.
