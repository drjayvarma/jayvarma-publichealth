## Key Points

* Infants under 1 year of age face rising measles risks with low vaccination rates nationwide.
* CDC recommends an early MMR dose at 6 to 11 months in outbreak-affected areas.
* Early doses are safe but still require two more shots, one at 1 year of age and the other at 4 to 6 years.

As the measles outbreak expands rapidly across the U.S., parents of infants face an agonizing dilemma: Is it safe to take my baby into public spaces?

For decades, American parents have relied on high levels of vaccination in the community to keep their babies safe from measles from the time they are born until they can get the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine at 12 months of age.

In 2025, with the virus now spreading and at least one child dead, should parents vaccinate their baby before they are 1 year old?

## How Big Is the Current Measles Outbreak?

Since the beginning of 2025, an outbreak in West Texas has led to measles outbreaks across the country. As of March 27, 2025, CDC reports that there are 483 confirmed cases in 19 states. The actual number of ill people may be substantially higher, because CDC is only reporting cases that are confirmed by a laboratory test or by an epidemiologic link to a laboratory-confirmed case.

Of the 483 confirmed cases, 70 have been sick enough to require hospitalization. Most troubling, a child under the age of 5 has died—the first measles-related death reported in the U.S. since 2015.

Measles is one of the most contagious diseases on earth, transmitted through the air by people who may not even have symptoms yet. Once measles enters a community with low vaccination coverage, it spreads rapidly, especially in places like daycares, schools, airports, and doctors’ offices.

## Does Measles Cause Long-Term Damage?

Measles is not simply a rash and fever. It can lead to pneumonia, deafness, blindness, and acute encephalitis, a life-threatening inflammation of the brain.

Even children who appear to recover from the illness can suffer long-term complications, such as encephalitis, weeks to months after infection or, in children infected before age 2, a deadly condition called subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) 10 years after infection.

Almost all people who have measles develop prolonged suppression of their immune system, putting them at risk of infections from other bacteria and viruses, even those they were previously vaccinated against.

There are no drugs to treat measles, which is why vaccination is so important.

## Why Is the First Measles Shot Given at 12 Months?

The current U.S. vaccine schedule calls for the first MMR dose to be given no sooner than 12 months of age and up to 15 months of age. It then calls for a second dose between the ages of 4 and 6. This schedule is based on extensive research on the immunology of the vaccine and detailed analysis of real-world data both here in the U.S. and in other countries.

Infants carry antibodies from their mother that help protect them during their first few months of life. The ability of these antibodies to protect a baby against measles fades over the first 12 months, but there are often just enough antibodies to interfere with the vaccine. These antibodies may prevent the infant’s immune system from mounting a strong response if they are vaccinated before 12 months. That’s why early vaccination was not recommended in the past.

Historically, experts believed that a single dose given at 1 year of age provided lifelong protection. But after large outbreaks occurred in vaccinated school-aged children during the late 1980s and early 1990s, researchers discovered that about 5 percent of children failed to respond to the first dose. That's when public health experts began recommending a second dose between the ages of 4 and 6 to ensure long-term immunity.

## Is Early Vaccination Safe and Effective?

When traveling with a baby to an area with high rates of measles, CDC and World Health Organization (WHO) recommend an early dose of MMR vaccine as early as 6 months of age. This is standard practice in low- and middle-income countries where measles is common, and multiple studies have confirmed its safety.

What’s different about an early dose is that public health agencies do not count this early vaccine as part of the required two-dose series. Immunity from this early dose may not last. Therefore, babies who receive an early dose must still get two additional doses—one at 12 to 15 months and another at 4 to 6 years. Fortunately, receiving additional doses is safe.

## Can I Check if My Baby Is Immune After an Early Measles Shot?

Some infants vaccinated before 12 months do achieve long-term protection, especially if:

* Maternal antibody levels are low
* The vaccine was given at 9 to 11 months of age

There are no widely available or affordable tests to identify whether a baby has developed a strong enough response to the first dose that they do not need additional doses after 12 months of age. Tests to assess immune response—such as for high-avidity antibodies or T-cell activation—are available only in research settings and are not reliable enough for guiding clinical decisions. It is safest, therefore, to receive the standard two doses after the baby is 12 months old.

## When to Get an Early Measles Shot?

Here’s why you may want to consider vaccinating your baby for measles before they are 12 months old.

* **Geographic location and exposure risk:** Are there confirmed cases of measles in your city or state? Are you traveling to a place with an outbreak?
* **Community vaccination coverage:** Does your daycare, school, or local community have high rates of vaccination? Is your baby routinely spending time with unvaccinated children or adults?
* **Infant’s age and health:** Infants 6 to 11 months old are eligible for early vaccination. Babies younger than 6 months are not, and their best protection is to avoid high-risk settings.

If you and your pediatrician agree that an early dose is appropriate, you should also discuss plans for completing the full vaccine series.

## How Will the Measles Outbreak End?

Measles is preventable. We have a safe, highly effective vaccine. The reason this virus is spreading in the U.S. in 2025 is that not enough people are getting vaccinated.

My hope is that this outbreak ends quickly as more parents vaccinate on time and more unvaccinated people catch up. Until then, if you’re the parent of a baby under 12 months old and you live in or are traveling to an area with measles cases, consider getting your child an early dose of measles vaccine.

An early dose may not have been part of your original plan—but given what we’re facing now, it may be the right choice.
