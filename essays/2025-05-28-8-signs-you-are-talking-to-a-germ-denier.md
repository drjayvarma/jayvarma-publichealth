## Key Points

* Germ denial reframes science as opinion and wellness as immunity.
* Healthy people still get sick from measles, meningitis, and flu.
* “Natural immunity” doesn’t mean infection is safe or smart.
* Misinformation often sounds like common sense or self-care.

In the United States, I am increasingly seeing people reject scientific consensus. Among the most dangerous forms of this rejection is the resurgence of germ denial: the belief that microbes are not a major cause of disease and death.

While some germ deniers go so far as to claim viruses and bacteria are not dangerous or, oddly, that they do not even exist, a more insidious version has spread rapidly since COVID-19 emerged. It’s cloaked in language about “natural health,” distrust of industry, and the promise of “boosting your immune system.”

All of us, whether we are health professionals, scientists, or just concerned citizens, need to recognize germ denial when we see it and push back against movements that endanger public health.

## What Is Germ Denial?

Germ theory is a foundational component of modern medicine. It states that many human diseases are caused by microorganisms—bacteria, viruses, parasites, and fungi—and that treating those microorganisms prevents these diseases. This idea has given us tools to prevent or treat illness, including vaccines, antibiotics, and sterilization.

Germ denial, by contrast, is the rejection or minimization of this well-established theory. Some germ deniers call themselves “terrain theorists,” promoting the 19th-century view that disease only happens in people with a “damaged terrain” (i.e., poor internal health), not because of microbes.

Here are eight arguments you may hear from someone who denies germ theory, even if they don’t say so outright.

## 1. They Claim “The Terrain” Is the Real Problem, Not Germs

> “If you’re healthy, you don’t need to worry about viruses.”

Germ deniers often argue that microbes alone cannot cause disease. Rather, people are only susceptible to infection and illness when they have poor nutrition, toxic exposures, or other underlying health conditions, such as diabetes or cancer.

The kernel of truth within these beliefs is that malnutrition and other health conditions do make people more susceptible to illness. But most germs are necessary and sufficient on their own to cause disease in healthy persons.

## 2. They Downplay Outbreaks or Blame the Victims

> “Those kids who died of measles were malnourished anyway.”

This argument is inaccurate and cruel. Healthy children and adults die from infectious diseases every year. Minimizing their deaths allows germ deniers to preserve their worldview while erasing human suffering.

## 3. They Blame Toxins, Not Pathogens

> “It’s the pollutants, not the virus, making people sick.”

Germ deniers often say environmental toxins, not pathogens, are the real culprits behind disease. This includes mercury, food dyes, or 5G. While various environmental exposures can be harmful and deadly, invoking these in a discussion about infections is used to distract from the overwhelming evidence that microbes are a leading cause of illness and death. Many exposures can cause disease. When it comes to microbes or other environmental agents, the answer is “yes and,” not “either or.”

## 4. They Say Lifestyle and Supplements Are Better Than Vaccines

> “You don’t need a vaccine if you eat right and take supplements.”

This is perhaps the most widespread form of germ denial. People are told they don’t need vaccines if they eat right, exercise, and take the right supplements. It reframes public health as a matter of personal wellness.

Diet and exercise are essential for health, but they cannot replace vaccines, which train the immune system to prevent infection in the first place. They get an immune reaction that protects them against the disease without having to be get the disease itself.

## 5. They Say Infections Are Good for You

> “You need natural immunity from infections to be healthy in the future.”

Some germ deniers claim that getting infected is actually helpful, that “natural immunity” from disease is better than any vaccine.

The kernel of truth in this argument is that humans do need exposure to microbes to develop a healthy immune system. We live in balance with trillions of microbes. Some help train our immune system to understand when a microbe is harmful or beneficial.

But germ deniers blur the line between the beneficial microbes in our bodies and the dangerous ones that cause illness. A child does not need to be sick from measles to develop into a healthy adult.

## 6. They Suggest Scientists Are Motivated Exclusively by Profit or Power

> “Big Pharma invented germs to sell you drugs.”

This idea echoes anti-vaccine rhetoric: that scientists and public health officials promote germ theory to enrich themselves. In reality, most infectious disease experts are public servants or academics, primarily motivated by curiosity and compassion, not stock portfolios. Of course, people who work on these diseases want to be paid for their work, but that is true of every sector in America.

## 7. They Believe Public Health Measures Are a Form of Control

> “Masks, lockdowns, and vaccines are just about control, not health.”

This conspiracy framework casts every infectious disease measure as a political power grab. Those of us who work in public health believe that health protection measures enhance freedom: they give us the freedom from infection and ill health, allowing us to walk, play, work, and gather more safely.

## 8. They Promote Unproven “Cures” or Supplements

> “Vitamin A prevents measles better than the vaccine.”

When germ denialists do offer solutions, they often center on supplements, detox regimens, or home remedies. These are sold as natural, empowering alternatives to medicine, but they’re rarely supported by evidence and can be harmful in high doses.

Many of us suspect this is primarily to profit off this misinformation. The drugs promoted by germ deniers are primarily agents with no proven efficacy against the disease they purport to treat, e.g., using a drug that treats parasites, like ivermectin or hydroxychloroquine, to treat a virus like COVID-19.

## Bottom Line

Germ denial often wears the mask of ‘wellness,’ ‘critical thinking,’ or ‘natural health.’ But at its core, it’s a rejection of the scientific method and shared knowledge that has reduced suffering and saved lives. In my next article, I’ll discuss techniques for talking to a germ denier.
