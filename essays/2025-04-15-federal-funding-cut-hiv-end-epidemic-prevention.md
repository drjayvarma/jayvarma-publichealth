The U.S. government has long been a leader in research and public health practice for preventing HIV infections. Since the start of the Trump administration in 2025, however, extensive cuts have been made or proposed to every federal agency that works on HIV.

These cuts threaten the United States’ goal of ending the HIV epidemic — an initiative launched during the first Trump administration — and will likely lead to substantial increases in HIV infections, HIV-related illness, and health care costs.

HIV prevention has long relied on three primary pillars: behavior, barriers, and biomedicine.

During the first three decades of the epidemic, public health programs focused primarily on the first two pillars. The most important behavioral interventions included delaying the onset of sexual activity, reducing the number of concurrent sexual partners, and avoiding needle sharing. Barrier interventions focused on increasing access to and acceptance of male condoms in health care and social settings.

In 2010, the publication of two landmark clinical trials began shifting the focus of prevention to a biomedical approach. The biomedical approach involves using a combination of HIV antiretroviral therapy medications to either prevent or treat HIV infection.

The [iPrEx trial](https://www.nejm.org), published in 2010, found that daily use of two ART medications markedly reduced the risk of acquiring HIV among men who have sex with men and transgender women. One year later, the [HPTN 052 trial](https://www.nejm.org) found that early initiation of ART (usually as a combination of three medications) in a person with HIV infection almost completely eliminated the risk of them transmitting HIV to an uninfected partner.

Subsequent studies across diverse populations — including injection drug users, heterosexual couples, and men who have sex with men — confirmed that ART can protect a person without HIV from getting infected and can render a person with HIV non-infectious (“undetectable” viral load means “untransmissible”).

## How did biomedical HIV prevention become part of national policy?

HIV experts began advocating for a paradigm shift in clinics and community services toward “[status neutral care](https://www.nyc.gov).” This is the model used in the clinics where I currently treat patients with or at risk of HIV: prevention and care is managed together by the same providers, just as happens with other chronic medical conditions such as diabetes or high blood pressure. All adult and adolescent patients are offered HIV testing, people who test negative are offered PrEP, and people who test positive are treated with ART.

In 2019, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force gave PrEP a [grade “A” recommendation for HIV prevention](https://jamanetwork.com), requiring health insurers to cover it at no cost as part of the Affordable Care Act. That same year, then-President Donald Trump announced the U.S. national plan to [End the HIV Epidemic](https://www.hiv.gov), which included PrEP for HIV uninfected and ART for HIV infected patients as core parts of its strategy.

## What is the current state of the HIV epidemic?

The U.S. government website ([HIV.gov](https://www.hiv.gov)) summarizes the [latest data](https://www.hiv.gov) on the domestic HIV epidemic. About 1.2 million people in the United States have HIV infection. About 13% of the 1.2 million HIV infected don’t know they are infected. An estimated 31,800 people acquired HIV infection in 2022, which was a 12% decrease from 2018.

Until recently, the U.S. government strategy to reduce HIV infections has focused on [expanding access to HIV prevention and care services](https://www.healthaffairs.org), particularly in communities disproportionately impacted by HIV: Black and brown people; gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men; transgender people; and people living in the South.

The U.S. government has also invested heavily in new biomedical innovation, supporting research into long-acting formulations that can make prevention and treatment even easier. The most promising innovation is lenacapavir, the first of a new class of HIV drugs (capsid inhibitors).

[Clinical trials](https://academic.oup.com) have demonstrated that one injection of lenacapavir every 6 months prevents HIV infection, and a recent small, early stage clinical trial generated substantial excitement for the possibility that it could be used once every 12 months – essentially mimicking an annual vaccine.

## What cuts have been made to HIV programs at the federal level?

All of this progress, however, is now at risk. A sweeping [combination of budget cuts, policy changes, and proposed reorganization of agencies](https://www.kff.org) suggests that the federal government is retreating from HIV prevention.

The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services is closing the Office of Infectious Disease and HIV/AIDS Policy (OIDP), which coordinates national strategy and publishes the [HIV epidemic dashboard](https://ahead.hiv.gov).

At the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases, key researchers have been removed from their positions, and HIV research grants have been cancelled.

Multiple programs within the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Division of HIV/AIDS Prevention have been cut, along with services for infectious diseases that impact people with HIV, such as sexually transmitted infections and viral hepatitis. The CDC/HRSA Advisory Committee on HIV, Viral Hepatitis, and STD Prevention and Treatment has also been disbanded, cutting off a key channel for expert input and public accountability.

HHS officials have discussed [removing HIV entirely from CDC](https://apnews.com) and placing it within the HHS program that provides HIV-related health care to people not covered by other insurance programs.

On top of these announced cuts are proposed reductions in Medicaid included in the congressional budget framework. Medicaid is the largest source of coverage for people with HIV and for low-income Americans at risk of HIV infection. If eligibility is narrowed, benefits are reduced, or states are given more leeway to drop enrollees, many individuals could lose access to PrEP and ART.

Globally, the defunding of the [U.S. President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief](https://www.state.gov/pepfar/) (PEPFAR) will increase the burden of HIV globally, eventually leading to more HIV infections spilling back into the United States through travel or migration.

## What will be the impact of legal and cultural changes on HIV prevention?

Beyond direct funding cuts, legal and cultural shifts present threats to HIV prevention.

A federal lawsuit before the Supreme Court questions whether the Affordable Care Act can mandate insurance coverage for PrEP at no cost to patients. If the court rules that this mandate violates religious freedom or exceeds government authority, it could lead to many insurance companies reducing coverage for PrEP.

The increase in anti-LGBTQ+ rhetoric and legislation is also having a chilling effect on HIV prevention programs. Clinics and community organizations that primarily serve gay and transgender populations are reporting increased harassment, threats to funding, and reduced participation by clients. These trends threaten to unravel decades of progress.
