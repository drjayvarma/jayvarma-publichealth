## Key Points

* After floods, water may look clean but it can carry dangerous levels of bacteria, viruses, and toxins.
* Wait 24–48 hours after rain before swimming in lakes, rivers, and oceans, especially near farms.
* Boil and filter drinking water if flooding affects your municipal supply or private well.

Water is a source of comfort for many of us, whether it's holding a full water bottle in our hands throughout the day or swimming to refresh our minds and bodies. The devastating floods in Texas and beach closures across the country are a reminder, however, that water may sometimes put our health at risk. Unfortunately, the risks of flooding and subsequent water contamination are increasing. It's important to understand why that’s happening and how you can take to enjoy water while staying active and healthy.

## Climate change is increasing the frequency of flooding

As climate change heats the atmosphere, the air holds more moisture, and rains fall heavier and faster than they have in the past. While the most immediate and devastating threats during a flood are death and physical injury, danger can persist after rains have stopped.

When more water falls from the sky in a shorter period, storm drains and sewers struggle to keep up. Floodwaters end up carrying sewage from manholes, waste from overwhelmed treatment plants, pesticides and fertilizers from farm fields, gasoline and oil from roads, and sometimes chemicals from industrial sites.

As a result, the water we use for drinking, cooking, fishing, and recreation can end up with a brew of bacteria, viruses, and toxins. Here are some of the most important ways you can stay safe from this.

## 1. Pay attention to water advisories

Local environmental and health agencies test recreational water sources for signs of contamination. They are checking for bacteria like *E. coli* and enterococci, which are common in the intestines of humans and animals. If levels of these bacteria are high, it suggests that sewers or agricultural waste have overflowed into recreational water. Health officials will then issue orders to close beaches to prevent skin, eye, ear, and gastrointestinal infections. Before you swim, check local government websites or signs posted at the site.

## 2. Avoid swimming after heavy rainfall

Even if there’s no official advisory, it's a good idea to wait 24–48 hours after a storm before swimming in natural water sources. Water may look clean yet still carry dangerous levels of bacteria. Stay out of the water if it appears cloudy, smells unusual, or has debris, visible foam, or scum. Be particularly careful about lakes or rivers near large farms, because manure and fertilizer from these farms can spill over after heavy rains.

## 3. If you do swim, protect your mouth, eyes, and open skin

The most common way people get sick from contaminated water is by swallowing it. Consider keeping your head above water when swimming in rivers or lakes after rain. Avoid diving or splashing water into your mouth. If you have cuts, abrasions, or a recent piercing or tattoo, cover them with waterproof bandages. After swimming, rinse off with clean water, and wash your hands with soap (or use hand sanitizer) before eating or drinking.

## 4. Be cautious about drinking water after a flood

If you live in an area affected by heavy flooding, follow local advisories about whether your tap water is safe to drink. In some cases, communities may issue boil water advisories or distribute bottled water.

If you use a private well system for your water, you may need to disinfect your well or test your water. Boiling water for at least one minute (or longer if at a high altitude) is effective against most bacteria and viruses. Using a filter with a pore size of 0.2 microns or smaller protects against parasites like *Giardia*, and ultra-filters and reverse osmosis systems can also reduce viruses.

## 5. Don’t fish or harvest shellfish during advisories

If a local health agency warns against swimming or water contact, it usually applies to fishing as well. Shellfish, especially those harvested from coastal waters, are vulnerable to algal blooms and sewage contamination. Red tides and similar conditions can release biotoxins that accumulate in shellfish and make you sick. Check government websites and signs before harvesting or eating shellfish if you caught them in the wild after a rain.

## 6. Advocate for the infrastructure that protects you

When I worked in Asia and Africa on public health, I spent a substantial time working on diseases most Americans never think of, such as typhoid and cholera. This is because systems were built in the United States, largely in the 1950s and 1960s, to keep clean water separate from waste and to disinfect the water piped into our homes.

Our sanitation systems are aging, and climate change is putting more stress on them than ever before. Government budget cuts also make it harder to invest in upgrading storm drains, sewage treatment plants, and other water infrastructure, as well as keeping people employed who test water and issue alerts. Pay attention to the discussions happening in your community and consider advocating for investments that keep the water and beaches you use safe.
