Last August, New York City became the first large U.S. jurisdiction to require people to verify they have been vaccinated against COVID-19 to participate in indoor commercial dining, fitness and entertainment. Combined with employer mandates, financial incentives and extensive community outreach, that program, known as Key to NYC, helped achieve a level of vaccination in adults — 87% fully vaccinated as of this week — that most public health people thought impossible one year ago.

On Monday, Mayor Adams announced that this program will end on March 7. Here is why he is wrong.

Since January 2020, public health experts have learned at least three important lessons about COVID-19.

First, we have no way to predict what the virus will do next. It may mutate into a strain that’s more infectious, more lethal, and/or more likely to cause “long COVID,” or it may remain mostly similar to omicron.

Second, COVID-19 vaccines provide strong protection against severe illness and death in anyone 5 years of age and older, and provide additional protection in those previously infected. Data from New York City during the omicron surge show that vaccination greatly reduced the risk of being infected, being hospitalized and dying.

Third, by the time a new variant has been detected globally and studies have demonstrated it is more dangerous, it has already found its way to New York City, the most globally interconnected city in the U.S.

The city’s strongest defense against future surges due to omicron or a new variant is to achieve and maintain high levels of population immunity. Key to NYC supports this defense in three ways.

One, it provides an ongoing incentive to get even more people vaccinated. Despite the city’s high overall vaccination levels, important gaps remain: 35% of Black adults, and 44% of all 5-to-17-year-olds are not fully vaccinated. The most important lesson from smoking, motor vehicle safety and other successful public health initiatives is that government needs to make healthy choices convenient and unhealthy choices inconvenient. Over time, unvaccinated New Yorkers will feel compelled to get vaccinated to participate in important activities, including parents who wish their children to benefit from museums, theater and sports events.

Two, Key to NYC provides an incentive to maintain high levels of vaccination among those who’ve already had their shots. Vaccination levels in the city will decline over time as new unvaccinated people move in and new children are born. It’s also inevitable that the definition of “fully vaccinated” will change in the future, as it has with almost all currently used vaccines. Keeping the program in place provides a system woven into the city’s fabric to ensure people stay up to date as vaccine guidance changes. This is particularly important for adults, who are both at highest risk of COVID-19 severe illness and who, unlike children, do not have annual check-ups and regular vaccine requirements for school.

Third, Key to NYC provides an additional layer of protection for workers who have frequent contact with large numbers of people. Even though vaccines are imperfect at preventing symptomatic infection, every additional layer of protection is important, and vaccinated people with breakthrough infections are less infectious than unvaccinated people.

There are four reasons to end this program: It is a burden on small businesses; it may dissuade tourists from coming to the city; its presence means the city is not “back to normal”; and the legal basis rests on the city being in a public health emergency.

Is there any evidence that the first three issues are a substantial problem? After the last existential threat to the city (9/11), New Yorkers adapted to substantially increased security screening, including identification checks in many buildings. Restaurant, bar and theater workers I have spoken to indicate the same is true with Key to NYC. The mayor should provide survey and polling data to support the argument that Key to NYC is substantially harming economic activity.

The legal basis seems, to me, the most important problem, because Key to NYC was implemented by a mayoral executive order. Maintaining this program in the future would require formalizing it through (Board of Health) regulation or (City Council) legislation.

No, Key to NYC does not need to continue forever, but the process of understanding a virus and developing the optimum tools to fight it takes years. To end COVID-19 vaccine verification, I think we need enough scientific certainty that the virus is not continuing to mutate into more dangerous forms and that our vaccination schedule, whatever it becomes, provides durable protection against all future variants in all age groups.

While it is an appropriate time to reconsider some public health protections, such as universal masking, let’s keep our strongest layer of defense as insurance for the uncertain future of COVID-19.
