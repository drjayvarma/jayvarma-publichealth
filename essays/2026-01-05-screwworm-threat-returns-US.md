## What screwworm is and why it matters

The New World screwworm is caused by the larvae of a blowfly called *Cochliomyia hominivorax*. The adult fly targets warm-blooded animals, most often cattle, and lays its eggs in open wounds such as those from branding, dehorning, tick bites, or minor abrasions. Within hours, the eggs hatch and the larvae burrow into living tissue, feeding aggressively. This distinguishes screwworm larvae from other maggots that eat only dead or decaying tissue.
As they grow, the larvae expand wounds, attract more flies, cause severe pain, tissue destruction, secondary infections, and often death if untreated. Mature larvae eventually drop to the soil, pupate, and emerge as adult flies, ready to infect more animals in just a few weeks under warm conditions. Before eradication, screwworm caused hundreds of millions of dollars in annual losses in the U.S., affecting livestock, wildlife, pets, and occasionally humans.

## How screwworm was controlled in the 20th century

In the mid-20th century, scientists developed the “sterile insect technique” to halt screwworm reproduction. This involved breeding millions of male screwworm flies, sterilizing them with radiation, and releasing them into the wild. Female screwworms mate only once; if that mating is with a sterile male, no offspring are produced and the population declines. Using this method, screwworm was eliminated from the U.S. by the mid-1960s, and coordinated regional efforts pushed the pest as far south as Panama by the early 2000s. Weekly releases of sterile flies created a biological barrier to prevent northward spread from endemic regions. This program was among the most successful international disease control efforts in the Americas, but required constant surveillance and sterile-fly production to maintain. ([Healthbeat][1])

## Why the screwworm threat has returned

For decades, screwworm was largely absent from the United States and Mexico until outbreaks began spreading northward in 2023 through Central America and into southern Mexico. Interrupted sterile fly production during the COVID-19 pandemic, increased movement of cattle and people, and challenges in surveillance across remote terrain likely contributed. In August 2025, the U.S. confirmed its first human screwworm case in decades in a Maryland resident returning from El Salvador, treated successfully. While local acquisition was not indicated, the rare human case signaled widespread animal prevalence. 

The economic implications are significant: U.S. cattle herd sizes are near historic lows due to drought and rising costs, and in response to the screwworm threat, the United States halted cattle imports from Mexico in 2025. Prolonged disruption could push beef prices higher. ([Healthbeat][1])

## What is being done to stop the New World screwworm outbreak

The United States and Mexico have begun rebuilding the capacity that previously stopped screwworm transmission. Sterile insect production in Panama has expanded to release roughly 100 million flies per week, facilities in southern Mexico are being renovated to produce tens of millions more, and the U.S. Department of Agriculture is working on additional dispersal capacity in Texas. Experts estimate several hundred million sterile flies per week may be needed to re-establish an effective barrier. Workforce reductions and loss of institutional memory pose challenges for rapid response. 

New tools have also emerged. In late 2025, the Food and Drug Administration conditionally approved a topical antiparasitic drug for cattle that can help treat or prevent screwworm infestations, though it is prescription only, has withdrawal periods, and cannot be used in all cattle.

## Why this matters beyond screwworm

The return of screwworm highlights broader lessons about public health and food security. Effective protections are often invisible, but when they fail, consequences are severe and costly. Addressing threats like screwworm requires a One Health approach that integrates human, animal, and environmental health sectors. At a time when resources for global health and disease surveillance are constrained, the screwworm resurgence underscores the importance of sustained investment in these systems.
