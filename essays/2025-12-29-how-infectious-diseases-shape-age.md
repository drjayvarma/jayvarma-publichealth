### Key points

* Infections across the life course can accelerate biological aging.
* Chronic inflammation links infectious diseases to age-related decline.
* Preventing and treating infections may improve long-term health and longevity.

For most of human history, infectious diseases were the dominant force shaping how long and how well people lived. While modern medicine has dramatically reduced deaths from infections, these diseases continue to influence how we age in ways that are less obvious but no less important.

I spend much of my professional life thinking about infectious diseases as acute events — an illness that begins, peaks, and resolves. But growing evidence suggests that infections can leave lasting biological “scars” that influence health decades later. Understanding this connection helps explain why preventing and treating infections remains central to healthy aging.

## Inflammation as a bridge between infection and aging

Aging is not just the passage of time. It is driven by biological processes, including chronic, low-grade inflammation. This phenomenon, sometimes called “inflammaging,” is linked to cardiovascular disease, diabetes, neurodegenerative disorders, and frailty.

Infectious diseases are powerful triggers of inflammation. While the immune system usually returns to baseline after an infection resolves, this is not always complete. Repeated or severe infections can lead to persistent immune activation, gradually accelerating the biological processes associated with aging.

## Childhood infections and lifelong effects

Infections early in life may be particularly important. Severe infections in childhood can alter immune system development, metabolism, and organ function. Studies have linked childhood infections to higher risks of chronic disease in adulthood, including heart disease and reduced lung function.

These findings underscore that aging begins far earlier than we usually think. Health in older age is partly determined by exposures — including infections — that occur decades before symptoms of aging appear.

## Chronic and latent infections

Not all infections fully disappear. Some viruses, such as herpesviruses, remain dormant in the body for life, periodically reactivating. Even when these reactivations cause few symptoms, they stimulate the immune system repeatedly.

Over time, this constant immune engagement can exhaust immune cells and contribute to immune aging. This may help explain why older adults respond less effectively to new infections and vaccines.

## Can preventing infections slow aging?

If infections accelerate aging, then preventing them may help preserve health later in life. Vaccination, clean air, safe housing, and access to medical care are not just tools to prevent short-term illness — they are investments in long-term health.

There is increasing interest in whether reducing infections across the lifespan could delay the onset of age-related diseases and disability. While we do not yet have definitive answers, the biological rationale is strong enough to warrant serious attention.

## Rethinking aging through an infectious disease lens

Aging is often framed as inevitable and immutable. Infectious disease research challenges this view by showing that social conditions, public health systems, and medical interventions can meaningfully influence how people age.

By preventing infections and mitigating their long-term effects, we may be able to extend not just lifespan, but healthspan — the years of life spent in good health.
