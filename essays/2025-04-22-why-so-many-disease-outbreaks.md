## Key Points

* Climate change drives new outbreaks by altering where people, animals, and insects can live.
* Livestock production and global meat trade accelerate the emergence of new superbugs.
* Staying informed and vaccinated reduces your risk in a new era of pandemics.

Bird flu in America. Marburg virus in Africa. Warnings about “Disease X.” These headlines are unsettling, but, for those of us who study infectious diseases, they have become the new normal.

We live in a new age of pandemics with newly emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases. Understanding why this is happening can help us stay safe and sane.

## Are There More Outbreaks Now?

Over the past two decades, the number of outbreaks reported around the world has grown significantly. Part of this is good news: Advances in laboratory technology and global reporting systems mean we detect threats faster than ever before. But better detection alone doesn’t explain the surge in outbreaks.

Think of it like a soccer game: Viruses and bacteria are playing offense, and the rest of us are playing defense. Unfortunately, their offense is evolving faster than our defense.

Here are five reasons why we are, in fact, seeing so many outbreaks, and why some diseases we thought were gone are coming back.

## Human Encroachment on Nature Sparks New Diseases

As humans push deeper into forests and jungles, we come into closer contact with wildlife. Most viruses that threaten humans—such as HIV, Ebola, or COVID-19—originated in animals. Humans eventually come into contact with these animals, and the virus “spills over” into humans.

Where does spillover occur? Most often, at the edge of forests or jungles, where rats, bats, and other disease-carrying species thrive.

Sometimes the jump is directly from the animal into the human, as we suspect happened with HIV in the early 20th century. Other times, it comes via a bite from an insect like a tick or mosquito, which shuttles the infection from animal into human. This is how bacterial illnesses like Lyme disease and viral illnesses like Dengue can emerge in new places and new populations.

## Factory Farming Increases Risk of "Superbugs"

As global incomes rise, more people want to eat more meat. That means more animals are raised in crowded conditions and shipped across countries and continents.

The places where animals are raised, the factories where they are slaughtered, and the markets in which they are sometimes sold live are breeding grounds for disease. In addition to new diseases emerging, old bacteria can mutate into new forms in these food factories. Many food producers use antibiotics in their animals to prevent disease and promote weight gain. Prolonged exposure to antibiotics selects for drug-resistant “superbugs” that no longer die when exposed to antibiotics.

## Rapid Urbanization Leads to Infectious Disease Outbreaks

More people are moving to live in cities. For most people, living in a big city makes financial sense because that’s where jobs and public services are concentrated. As a result, there are now 37 cities around the world, most in Asia, with more than 10 million residents.

Cities make it easy, however, for a disease to spread from one person to many other people very quickly. A virus that might once have burned out in a rural village can now spread rapidly in a crowded city.

## Global Travel Accelerates the Spread of Infectious Diseases

Planes can carry people—and their pathogens—across the globe in hours. International travel makes it easier for viruses to hitch a ride. It’s no coincidence that cities like New York, with vast numbers of international arrivals, are often the first hit during global outbreaks. Zika, COVID-19, and mpox all followed this pattern.

## Climate Change Increases the Risk of Disease Outbreaks

Rising temperatures, shifting rainfall patterns, and extreme weather are accelerating all the above. They drive human migration, alter where animals and insects can live, and disrupt traditional agriculture. The result: more human-animal-insect interactions in places where they did not previously happen.

Diseases once considered “tropical” are now turning up in temperate climates, such as dengue in California and malaria in Florida.

## How to Protect Yourself and Your Family

Here are some practical steps we can all take to keep ourselves safer and healthier, even with so many new infectious diseases spreading.

* Make sure you and your family are up to date on vaccinations, especially as diseases like measles that were previously controlled are now spreading throughout the United States. If you’re eligible for newer vaccines, like those for RSV or mpox (monkeypox), talk to your doctor about getting them.
* We now have another reason to do all of the things we know that improve health, such as diet, exercise, sleep, reducing alcohol intake, and avoiding tobacco products. Chronic diseases like diabetes and heart disease make us more vulnerable to being infected and suffering severe complications from an infection.
* Information is also a form of protection. Staying informed about outbreaks through reliable sources can help you prepare without panicking. Even thinking for just a few minutes about how you’d handle a “boil water” alert or reports of bird flu spreading between people can reduce anxiety and help you respond more effectively if these dangerous events happen.
* Work in your community to support public health services. Diseases don’t care about borders or ideologies, but how we prepare for them is a choice.

## How to Live Safely in an Age of Pandemics

We can’t go back to a time before COVID-19, bird flu, and Ebola, just like we never returned to the pre-9/11 era of airport security. But we can adapt. Learning to live in a world of microbial threats means rethinking how we care for ourselves and how we support one another. While we cannot eliminate risk, we can reduce our vulnerability and strengthen our resilience.
