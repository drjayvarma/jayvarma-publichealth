## To answer that question, look at what happened after the Soviet Union’s public health system was dismantled

In my over 25 years as a health professional, I remember the two times I feared that infectious diseases might devastate the US and the world.

The first was when I was in my second year of CDC’s famed disease detective program (the “Epidemic Intelligence Service” that the Trump administration attempted to cut then held off) and heard about a new pneumonia spreading through China and Southeast Asia. That disease, SARS, was extinguished through aggressive control measures by countries throughout the world. That was possible because of a lucky happenstance of the virus itself: the people most likely to spread SARS were also the sickest and, therefore, they could be easily identified and isolated before they spread it to many other people.

The second time I felt that fear was two decades later, in December 2019, when I read an email in my inbox about another pneumonia spreading in a region of China I knew well. From 2008–2011, I had worked in and around Wuhan, China building lab and data collection systems to detect new emerging respiratory viruses and bacteria. I was one of small team of public health experts from CDC that the Chinese government had approved to work with them on strengthening their public health system after SARS. COVID-19, unlike SARS, unfortunately, could be spread by people with no or minimal symptoms and, as a result, continues to spread, with over a million American lives lost in the first two years of the pandemic. Even worse is that it continues to cause severe illness and death — and not just from respiratory illness.

In a cruel twist of fate, the backlash against COVID-19 has now led us to the third time in my life that I fear what will happen to our country from infectious diseases: the appointment of Robert F. Kennedy, Jr to lead all US government health programs.

## The Feds Pay for Most Infectious Disease Control

Congress appropriates funding to the Department of Health and Human Services and its subsidiary agencies (including CDC) to support state and local health departments. This money pays a huge percentage (over 80% when I was in charge of infectious diseases for New York City) for every disease control program you can imagine — from immunizations to HIV to opiate overdoses and chronic diseases.

What happens when the funding for staff, information systems, laboratory systems, supplies, and equipment is suddenly “deleted” or, if we’re lucky, only cut in half?

The answer is — and this is no exaggeration — the disease control programs will die slowly, then quickly. Next the humans will die slowly, then quickly.

## Back in the USSR

The most recent analog I can think of is what happened after the dissolution of the USSR. Up until 1990, the USSR had a highly organized and centrally managed public health system, with extensive, equitable coverage throughout its vast and diverse republics.

With its dissolution, there was no central entity to pay for and distribute drugs and vaccines or keep staff employed. Within a few years, there were massive outbreaks of vaccine-preventable disease, HIV and other sexually transmitted infections, and tuberculosis (TB). Life expectancy was cut by almost a decade in some groups.

What happened in the USSR was entirely predictable. In my global health career, I learned that if you want to do a quick-and-dirty assessment of how well a country’s public health system is functioning, just look at it’s immunization and TB programs. These are programs that fundamentally require a government investment, because there is no major profit incentive for doctors and hospitals to track down unvaccinated people or people recently exposed to measles, mumps, or meningitis and ensure they get their vaccines. Or to find people with TB in the community and ensure they get every dose of their TB drugs for several months, and to find people exposed to TB and make sure they get TB preventive drug therapy. TB and immunization programs are market failures — they require an investment of public money, because they benefit everyone and there is no private sector incentive to address them.

There is a long list of infectious diseases that are likely to surge over the next four years with the Trump administration’s cuts to staff, supplies, and systems. Here are three that I worry about the most right now, because they are both likely to come back quickly and to cause severe illness and death the moment they do.

## Measles: The First Sign of a Failing Health System

Measles is one of the most contagious diseases known to humans. The virus spreads through the air, with particles able to hang around in the air for hours after an infected person has left a room. If there is a room with 100 unvaccinated people in it, a single infected person can spread measles to 90 of them in a single encounter.

When vaccination rates fall even slightly in a community (95% is considered the threshold for “herd immunity”), measles begins spreading rapidly as soon as single infected person exposes someone unvaccinated in that community.

Three populations are most at risk of severe illness and death: children under 5 (particularly those less than a year old), pregnant women, and immunocompromised individuals. Even in mild cases, measles suppresses the immune system for months, leaving people vulnerable to other infections for years.

History shows what happens when measles vaccination rates collapse. In the 1990s, measles cases exploded in the former Soviet republics. More recently, Venezuela saw a resurgence of measles after economic collapse disrupted its healthcare system, leading to thousands of cases and many deaths. (Ironically, that outbreak was controlled with funding from USAID.)

The U.S. is already experiencing warning signs with a large and growing outbreak in a community in Texas in which over 10% of school-age children were given exemptions from vaccination.

In 2019, measles outbreaks hit under-vaccinated communities in New York, Washington, and California, fueled by misinformation and vaccine refusal. These were contained only because public health agencies had the funding and personnel to respond. What happens when those resources are stripped away? When CDC’s disease detectives are no longer assigned to state and local health departments, and CDC is no longer funding support staff, information systems, and even vaccine supplies at those agencies?

## Tuberculosis: The Rise of Drug-Resistant Strains

Tuberculosis (TB) is a caused by a unique type of bacteria that primarily infects the lungs but can spread to almost any other organ in the body. Similar to measles, TB spreads through the air, but, unlike measles, it requires more prolonged exposure, such as occurs in homes, homeless shelters, prisons, and long-term care facilities.

Even with recent advances in treatment, patients with active TB disease must take a combination of antibiotics for months. If treatment is interrupted — due to lack of access, poor adherence, or drug shortages — resistant strains develop. In the most extreme form, these multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) strains require prolonged treatment with drugs that are toxic and expensive.

The unstable supply of drugs in the former Soviet republics in the 1990s led to a surge in drug-resistant TB. Without access to full treatment courses, patients took drugs erratically, and MDR-TB strains evolved and spread rapidly. Today, Russia, Ukraine, and other countries in the region continue to struggle with finding and treating the MDR-TB cases that emerged during that time.

The US is not immune to this threat. Before COVID-19, TB cases in the US were at an all-time low due to strong public health programs. But in recent years, TB cases have increased, and funding cuts could accelerate this trend. Just look at what is happening in Kansas.

For years, TB was the one disease that public health agencies used aggressive measures to control; public health authorities had the legal authority to detain and isolate anyone who had infectious TB and did not take their medications consistently and correctly. Many states, however, have reacted to COVID-19 control measures by stripping public health agencies of this authority, setting up the stage for TB to return.

## Diphtheria: A Forgotten Killer Ready to Return?

Diphtheria is a bacterial infection that spreads through respiratory droplets. The bacteria release a potent toxin that damages the upper respiratory tract, causing severe inflammation that essentially suffocates the infected person. That toxin can also cause severe damage to the heart, nerves, and kidneys. While rarely seen in the US today due to widespread vaccination, individuals without symptoms may carry the bacteria and spread it to others, posing a hidden risk.

History tells us what happens when vaccination breaks down: diphtheria reemerges with deadly force.
