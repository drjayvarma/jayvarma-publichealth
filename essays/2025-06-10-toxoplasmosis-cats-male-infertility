## Key Points

* Animal studies consistently show reproductive damage across species from *Toxoplasma* infection.
* There have been no large, high-quality studies in humans demonstrating *Toxoplasma* causes male infertility.
* Everyone should properly handle cat litter, cook meat thoroughly, and wash fruits and vegetables.

Men’s rights and "manosphere" commentators frequently mock "cat ladies" and lament declining birth rates. Emerging science suggests that there may, in fact, be a link between these two obsessions, but not in the way that they think. A parasite spread by cats might damage male sperm and lead to infertility.

I recently learned about this connection when I read an essay by a professor who researches *Toxoplasma gondii*.

Is this hype or cause for concern? Let’s look at the data the same way an epidemiologist does when trying to determine whether a correlation may actually be causation.

## What is Toxoplasma infection?

*Toxoplasma gondii* is a parasite that is estimated to infect one-third of human and animal populations around the world. The parasite begins as microscopic eggs that cats shed when they poop in a litter box or outside. These eggs can survive in the environment for months, and humans become infected when they come into contact with *Toxoplasma* eggs in litter boxes, gardens, water, and unwashed produce.

Once inside an animal or human, these eggs release active parasites that multiply rapidly before forming dormant cysts in tissues. The cysts are protective capsules containing the parasite that become lodged within muscles and organs. This is the second way humans become infected: eating the cysts in undercooked meat from an infected animal.

If a human has been infected with either the eggs or the cysts, the parasite can live forever in a person’s brain, heart, and muscle tissue. While this sounds scary, this infection is usually only important to worry about in two situations: a severe immune-compromising condition (e.g., HIV/AIDS) or pregnancy. If a person becomes infected for the first time during pregnancy, the parasite can infect and damage the developing baby. That is why pregnant women are instructed to avoid cleaning a cat’s litter box.

## Is there a biological basis to believe Toxoplasma causes infertility?

When deciding if an infection is a cause of a disease, we first ask: Is there a biological reason to believe this is possible? For *Toxoplasma* and male infertility, the answer is yes. Laboratory studies demonstrate that, in animals, *Toxoplasma* can:

* Rapidly colonize the testes and epididymis
* Form persistent cysts in prostates and testes
* Directly damage sperm structure
* Promote chronic inflammation, which impairs sperm production and function

These animal studies consistently show reproductive damage. Infected mice, rats, and rams exhibit reduced sperm counts, abnormal sperm morphology, and diminished testicular function.

## Are there data from human studies about Toxoplasma and infertility?

To date, studies in humans have been “cross-sectional”: analyzing a group of people at one moment in time and seeing whether there are higher rates of infertility in people with *Toxoplasma* infection.

Two studies on men found an association between infection and sperm abnormalities. A 2021 Prague study found that fertility problems were significantly higher in 163 *Toxoplasma*-infected men (49 percent) compared with 506 (42 percent) uninfected men. A 2002 study in China found higher rates of *Toxoplasma* infection when comparing 100 sterile men (36 percent infected) to 100 fertile men (14 percent infected).

One study in Chinese couples found higher rates of *Toxoplasma* infection when comparing 178 infertile couples (35 percent) with 190 fertile couples (12 percent).

## Do the human data prove that Toxoplasma causes male infertility?

In epidemiology, we prefer to see studies that enroll large numbers of people, follow them over time, and use standardized methods. We don’t yet have those studies for *Toxoplasma* and infertility.

In these studies, we want to see more than just an association between infection and infertility. We also want to see evidence for temporality and a dose-response relationship. Temporality means that *Toxoplasma* infection comes first, then male infertility comes later. Dose-response means that the more exposure there is to *Toxoplasma* (higher dose, longer duration, or both), the more severe the infertility. Neither has been shown yet in human studies.

We also have some reasons to believe that *Toxoplasma* is not a cause of infertility. First, male infertility rates appear to be rising, while *Toxoplasma* infection rates are not. Second, not all human studies show a consistent relationship.

## Should men worry about Toxoplasma infection?

The *Toxoplasma*-male infertility association meets some criteria for causation. The biological mechanism is understood, and animal studies consistently show reproductive damage across species. At the same time, human epidemiological studies are small and methodologically limited.

Here's my overall assessment:

* We need large prospective human studies on *Toxoplasma* and male infertility to determine if the correlation we see in small studies is causation.
* There’s not enough evidence to recommend that men with infertility seek testing or treatment for *Toxoplasma*.
* Everyone should use simple measures to prevent *Toxoplasma* infection because these measures have no harm and also protect against other infections: Properly handle cat litter, cook meat thoroughly, and wash fruits and vegetables.

So is cat ownership both a trope of a childless woman and an actual cause for fewer children being born? For now, the answer is "stay tuned."
