Flu has arrived earlier than usual this year, before health systems have fully prepared and before vaccination campaigns have reached their peak. In clinics, clinicians are already seeing high fever, sore throat, and body aches associated with positive influenza tests — indicating a flu season that is arriving early, spreading fast, and sending more people to the hospital. The United States is heading into a flu season that is likely to be worse than what has been experienced in recent winters. ([Healthbeat][1])

## Why this flu season is likely to be severe

Several factors are converging to increase the likelihood of a severe flu season. The dominant strain is influenza A H3N2, which has accumulated mutations that allow it to partially evade prior immunity, driving early and large flu surges in parts of the northern hemisphere. ([Healthbeat][1])

Flu has also arrived before health systems were fully prepared and before vaccination efforts have peaked. Reduced protective behaviors like masking, staying home when sick, and improved ventilation have faded since the COVID pandemic, and fewer Americans are getting their annual flu vaccine. Hospitals are entering the winter with little reserve capacity, making a severe flu season more challenging to manage. ([Healthbeat][1])

## What we know about this year’s flu vaccine

Influenza viruses mutate rapidly, and this year’s seasonal flu vaccine may not perfectly match circulating strains. Early data suggest reduced reactivity between the vaccine strain and the circulating virus. However, vaccination still substantially reduces severe illness, emergency department visits, and hospital admissions. ([Healthbeat][1])

## What public health agencies can do now

While federal promotional campaigns for flu vaccination may be limited this year, state and local health departments can fill that gap by promoting flu vaccines across available channels and engaging social media influencers to spread accurate information. Targeted efforts in nursing homes, assisted living facilities, shelters, and correctional settings are critical. ([Healthbeat][1])

Clinicians should be reminded that antiviral medications such as oseltamivir are most effective when started soon after symptom onset, especially for populations at high risk of complications, including young children, pregnant people, older adults, and individuals with chronic conditions.

## What health care facilities can do now

Hospitals and clinics still have time to bolster capacity for future surges. Ensuring staff do not become severely ill with influenza is key. Screening patients for respiratory symptoms at intake, isolating and testing them for influenza and other respiratory viruses, and maintaining masking policies for visitors in patient care areas remain effective tools during high respiratory virus circulation periods. Upgrading airflow, central air filtration, and using portable air purifiers in crowded spaces can reduce viral spread indoors. ([Healthbeat][1])

## What employers can do now

Employers can influence flu spread within offices and communities by offering paid time off for vaccination, providing on-site flu clinics, and encouraging employees to stay home when sick or work remotely rather than coming in despite illness. Providing high-quality masks and home test kits can protect workforce health and continuity. ([Healthbeat][1])

## What individuals can do

This is the first flu season since major cuts to federal infectious disease and immunization programs, making proactive steps more important than ever. Individuals should get vaccinated if they have not already, keep high-quality masks and home test kits available, test early if symptoms start, and contact a health care provider promptly if they are at higher risk and may benefit from antiviral treatment.
