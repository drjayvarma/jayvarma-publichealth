Public health experts agree that five interventions saved the most lives in the past century: clean water, sanitation, nutrition, vaccines, and antibiotics. Will artificial intelligence join that list in the 21st century, helping to avert illness and extend life expectancy?

Having led public health programs around the world for the past two decades, I believe that AI represents the single biggest opportunity to improve public health in my lifetime. As new diseases emerge more rapidly, and climate change increases other threats to health, officials may be able to use AI to practice public health with greater speed, precision, and effectiveness.

## AI revolution in health amplifies intelligence

In his 2024 book “The Coming Wave,” Mustafa Suleyman describes how humans came to dominate the Earth through their intelligence — the ability to develop, transmit, and implement ideas — and the application of that intelligence to develop energy, cultivate food, improve shelter, and enhance health. AI is, of course, the culmination of that process. We have created technology that amplifies our intelligence far beyond our biological capacity, allowing us to build things we never could have built before.

Generative AI tools like ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, and Microsoft Co-Pilot have demonstrated how AI dramatically improves the speed and productivity of “cognitive labor,” particularly writing text for humans, code for computers, or analyses of data in written or numeric format. This is why some also prefer to call it “augmented intelligence.”

The next waves of AI will go beyond ingesting and producing text to augment other functions of the human brain, such as vision, hearing, and speech.

## How will AI improve health care delivery and R&D?

Billions of dollars are being invested around the world to design and implement AI for health-related purposes. The health sector can broadly be classified into three areas: research and development; health care delivery; and public health. Much of the money is flowing into the first two areas of the health sector.

Investments in health research are particularly promising, because practical uses of AI are emerging at the exact same time as another transformative technology is also emerging: synthetic biology.

Decades of research into biology has given scientists tools to decode the genes behind all forms of life and, most important, write that genetic code to create new biological entities that treat disease, kill pathogens, break down waste, and make new materials. Developing new products for human health — drugs, diagnostics, vaccines, and devices — requires years of intensive work across multiple disciplines. In drug development, this includes optimizing the formulation, dosing, and delivery in animals and then humans, and, most important, to demonstrating safety and efficacy in large, diverse populations using rigorous protocols. Much of this work is repetitive, cognitive, and rule-based, the kind of pattern-heavy work AI is built to do.

Especially in the United States, where health care accounts for over 20% of the economy, there is tremendous investment into AI to improve how health care services are delivered to individual patients. Entire medical journals, and sections of prestigious medical journals, are now devoted to the burgeoning field of digital health. AI has already moved from the developer’s screen to the clinic with chatbots, scheduling, decision support, diagnostic support, and care management. At my clinic, we are testing “ambient AI” technology in which a system listens in the background while I perform a history and physical examination on a patient, then serves as a digital, autonomous medical scribe, preparing notes and orders for me to review and approve.

Many believe that it is not long in the future until the first interaction a person has with a doctor is an AI physician. Multiple studies have shown that AI can already out-perform clinicians on screening, diagnosis, and treatment in different clinical settings and patient populations.

## Public health practice needs AI investment

Where does that leave public health, the third part of the health sector?

In its most broad sense, public health means everything a society does to prevent disease and promote the health of humans. Public health practice refers to the work of people in public health, including: monitoring the health of a population, developing and implementing policies and programs to improve health, generating evidence to guide health policies, and responding to outbreaks and other emergencies. Most of this work is done by people working for government, because most countries recognize that public health is a form of public safety, like police and defense, and that private markets alone cannot meet its demands.

With sufficient resources and political will, current generative AI tools could be used right now to improve:

1. Ingesting, cleaning, and analyzing surveillance and other health-related data, including nowcasting and forecasting for different scenarios
2. Aggregating evidence and local data from diverse real-world sources to aid decision-making during routine health operations and emergencies
3. Tailoring reports, written communications, and graphical media to different audiences, including elected officials, media, and general public
4. Improving health care service delivery for immunizations, sexually transmitted infections, tuberculosis, and maternal child health programs through chatbots, medical decision support, and patient engagement before and after services
5. Preparing applications and reports for grants and other outside funders

## Four critical challenges for public health and AI

While I am optimistic about the future of AI for improving health, I do worry that public health practice could still fall behind or, worse, be harmed by AI. Here are my top four concerns.

#### The public health workforce

Much of the work in public health agencies can broadly be considered cognitive manual labor. I previously hoped that AI could be used for task shifting. For example, a public health program that currently requires 10 epidemiologists could use AI to shift at least half of them away from desks to working directly with communities on disease prevention, diagnosis, treatment, and emergency response — a shift that could address one of the ways public health struggled during COVID-19.

In 2025, however, there have been widespread efforts to dismantle public health domestically and globally, with agencies gutted, funding slashed, and legal authorities reduced at the state and federal level. The Department of Government Efficiency initiative includes efforts to fire federal workers and replace them with AI, rather than shift those workers to other services. Will a new public health agency that relies on AI be able to maintain essential public health services? What happens in an emergency when public health workers who would normally be reassigned from routine work to emergency response are no longer available?

#### The investment gap in public health

AI investment chases profit, which means AI funding will inevitably flow to financial markets, business and consumer applications, and entertainment. For the health sector, AI funding will flow to the areas where there is the most money to be made: developing new drugs and caring for sick people. Public health, which prevents people from needing expensive drugs and health care, is unlikely to receive similar levels of investment, particularly since much of the U.S. public health system is operated by government and not-for-profit agencies.

#### Data access and privacy

Most of the critical data needed for public health are owned and controlled by the private sector — including pharmacies, hospitals, laboratories, and insurance companies. Health departments often have to negotiate laboriously to obtain access, sometimes through legal mandates, but often through relationships and contracts. AI tools will only be as powerful as the data that feeds them, and without reliable, timely, and comprehensive data, AI could fail to improve or even harm public health.

Privacy remains another major concern. Even though public health agencies are authorized to access and use identifiable data for protecting the public’s health, they must maintain public trust. If AI systems are not designed with strong privacy protections and transparency, they could trigger backlash and further weaken public health authority.

#### Risk of widening inequities

Finally, AI could exacerbate inequities in health. Public health already struggles to address disparities in resources and outcomes across income, race, and geography. If AI tools are designed mainly for well-resourced settings, they may widen these gaps. Public health officials must insist that AI be developed and tested in diverse populations and settings, and that tools are adapted to meet the needs of underserved communities.

## Conclusion

Artificial intelligence could become as transformative for health as vaccines and antibiotics. But realizing that potential will require investment, safeguards, and a recognition that AI should strengthen — not replace — the human workforce that makes public health possible.
