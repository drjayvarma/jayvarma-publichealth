## Key Points

* Most people spend 90 percent of their time indoors, where air pollution and viruses easily accumulate.
* Ventilation, filtration, and UV light are proven tools for reducing airborne health risks indoors.
* Poor indoor air quality can impair thinking, worsen allergies, and increase infectious disease spread.
* Clean air should be seen as essential infrastructure—like clean food, water, or sanitation.

We take thousands of breaths every day, yet rarely stop to ask: What’s in the air we’re breathing? The answer, unfortunately, is viruses, allergens, and pollution, invisible threats to our health and well-being. There’s a lot of evidence that shows we can reduce those threats and improve our well-being and performance. But too few people and organizations are investing in indoor air quality.

## How Does Indoor Air Affect Our Health?

People spend nearly 90 percent of their time indoors. While the United States has rules for clean air outdoors—regulating the emissions from cars and factories—there are no national standards for the air we breathe indoors. That’s a huge problem because infectious diseases and air pollutants accumulate at much higher concentrations indoors compared with outdoors.

The COVID-19 pandemic brought substantial attention to the dangers of indoor spaces in spreading diseases. COVID-19, influenza, measles, and other viruses can all spread via small particles that hang in the air, sometimes for hours in poorly ventilated spaces. Unlike bacteria found on surfaces or in food and water, pathogens in the air can travel from one person to many others in just a few minutes and across a room.

A team of researchers recently conducted a large review of all the studies done on how making indoor air cleaner can improve our health. This report found that filtering and disinfecting indoor air reduces the frequency of infections but also improves health in other important ways.

Cleaner indoor air reduces allergy symptoms, and it can even improve overall brain function. In one observational study conducted among 302 office workers in six countries, people responded faster and more accurately to a color-word and addition-subtraction tests when the air they were breathing in their offices had less fine particulate matter and better ventilation (as measured by carbon dioxide levels).

## What Tools Do We Have to Clean Indoor Air?

We already know how to make indoor air safer. Decades of research—and practical experience during the pandemic—show that three main approaches can reduce airborne infections:

1. **Ventilation:** Bringing in fresh outdoor air to dilute and displace indoor air. This can be as simple as opening windows or as complex as retrofitting HVAC systems to increase air exchange.
2. **Filtration:** Using physical filters, like HEPA filters, to remove pathogens and pollutants from the air. These can be installed in centralized systems or used in portable air purifiers.
3. **Germicidal UV (GUV):** Using ultraviolet-C light to inactivate airborne viruses and bacteria. Modern GUV systems, designed correctly, are safe, effective, and already in use in hospitals and some shelters.

Each method has its pros and cons. Natural ventilation is low-cost but weather-dependent. Portable purifiers are flexible, but they clean the air only in small rooms. Centralized systems require investment. GUV carries outdated fears about safety, despite being in use for decades. That said, when used alone or in combination, these interventions work.

## Why Don't We Already Clean Air in Homes, Offices, and Schools?

If the science is clear and the technologies are available, what’s stopping us? In my view, the problem is primarily cultural and psychological. We don’t think of the air we breathe in the same way that we treat the food we eat or the water we drink.

Part of the reason is visibility. With food and water, we can see, taste, or smell contamination, and we can observe how the food is being cooked or how the water is being run through a filter. With air, there’s no such feedback. We cannot see a virus floating in the air, we cannot readily smell the difference between HEPA-filtered and unfiltered air, and we cannot easily see what an air filter or GUV system is doing. That makes it harder for people to grasp the stakes and the benefits.

Cost is another barrier. Even when institutions know air cleaning is important, retrofitting older buildings or buying new equipment feels like a luxury expense, especially without an easily measurable return on investment.

Finally, there is the problem of metrics. The two most common ways to assess indoor air quality—air changes per hour and carbon dioxide levels—are abstract and hard to translate into action. Unlike a thermometer, which tells you if someone has a fever, there is not yet a simple, accurate, affordable device that tells you: This room has bad air quality with infectious flu particles in the air.

## What Can We Do Now to Improve Indoor Air Quality?

* Health professionals should advise their patients about the value of cleaning indoor air, especially if they have health conditions that put them at greater risk from infectious diseases or allergens in the air.
* Journalists should write about indoor air quality, and people should ask their local and national legislators what they are doing to improve air inside schools, offices, healthcare facilities, and other settings. This will help shift clean air to the same level of importance as clean food and water.
* If you can afford it, buy and use portable air purifiers for your homes. The more consumers buy them, the lower the prices get. It’s even possible to make a high-quality air purifier yourself using relatively cheap products from a hardware store.

While the COVID-19 pandemic revealed the danger of ignoring airborne threats, improving indoor air is not simply about infection control. It is about improving our overall health and performance.
