## Key Points

* Gonorrhea can infect the throat without causing symptoms, making it easy to spread undetected.
* Studies in gay men show that kissing may transmit gonorrhea from throat-to-throat.
* Straight men and women are rarely tested in their throats for sexually transmitted infections.
* Self-swabbing your throat is safe, effective, and increasingly available at clinics offering STI testing.

I got one of the more unusual and interesting messages earlier this year: Can you help a friend out with a gonorrhea outbreak in her home? There was no way I was going to say no to that.

After learning more, I became concerned that gonorrhea may be spreading more widely in people’s throats than we realize, that kissing may be one culprit, and that sexually active adults should be getting tested in their throats more often.

## An Outbreak of Gonorrhea at a Party

When I contacted this person, I learned that she and her husband live in a major metropolitan area in the Midwest, where they frequently host sex parties. At one party, 10 men and 10 women attended. Women had sex with both men and women, and men only with women. Condoms were used for toys and vaginal and anal sex, but not oral sex.

Here’s where things got even more interesting. The hosts asked everyone to get tested for sexually transmitted infections (STI) within five days after the party, and, more importantly, to make sure people got more than just their genitals tested. They wanted to also see if people had STIs in their throat and anus as well.

After the party, five of the men tested positive for gonorrhea in both their throat and urine, as did five of the women. None of them had symptoms.

## How is Gonorrhea Testing Performed?

It helps to have some background about STI testing before we go further. When getting tested for gonorrhea and chlamydia, the standard approach is to test a patient’s urine. It’s less invasive and equally as reliable for as swabbing the genitals.

But these two bacteria can also infect the anus and the throat, the other locations where people interact sexually. To test these locations, doctors ask you to run a swab around the back of your throat or just inside your anus. Studies and real-world experience, including in my clinic, show it is safe and accurate for people to collect these specimens themselves.

As of now, CDC and most experts only recommend this more extensive testing—referred to as “three-site testing” for genitals, anus, and throat—in people who have symptoms or in asymptomatic men who have sex with men (MSM) and transwomen who have sex with men. This is because rates of gonorrhea and chlamydia infections in the throat and anus are high among MSM and transwomen, and it’s assumed that women and straight men do not practice oral and anal sex as frequently as other groups.

## How Does Gonorrhea Spread to the Throat?

So let’s get back to the party. How did 50% of men get infected if they only had sex with women and used condoms when they had penis-in-vagina sex with a woman? And how did women get infected if they used condoms for vaginal sex?

The most likely explanation is that they got infected with their mouths. This matters because I suspect oral transmission is more common than we realize, and there is a lot about these infections we do not understand.

Gonorrhea can infect the throat, but people do not always have sore throat, fever, or other symptoms. Almost all studies done on gonorrhea in the throat have focused on MSM, not on straight men and women. The estimate is that up to 17% of MSM have throat gonorrhea infections at any given time.

One study done in straight men and women with gonorrhea infection in their genitals found that 39% of them also had it in their throats.

## Why Worry About Gonorrhea Infections in the Throat?

One of the challenges about gonorrhea is that you can be infected but not have any obvious symptoms of infection.

If you never get tested and just have gonorrhea hanging out in your throat, is it a danger to you? We know these infections remain in people’s throats, even without symptoms, for four months or longer. And we know that asymptomatic infections in the genitals can lead to infertility and more severe infections. But we do not know if gonorrhea infection in the throat always harms the person carrying it.

If you never get tested and just have the infection hanging out there, is it a danger to others? Almost certainly, because there is a risk of transmitting it to other people, as we saw in this party. Unfortunately, we do not know exactly which sex acts led to infections at the party. Was it throat-to-throat, throat-to-penis, penis-to-throat, throat-to-vulva, or vulva-to-throat?

## Does Kissing Spread Gonorrhea?

We assume most gonorrhea spread is from throat-to-penis, throat-to-anus, and vice versa. But it could also be throat-to-throat – that is, through kissing. Studies among MSM in Australia have found that kissing is one of the strongest risk factors for gonorrhea infection of the throat.

I suspect kissing may have transmitted gonorrhea at this party and is happening more frequently among all sexually active adults. There are likely far more undiagnosed and untreated gonorrhea throat infections than we realize, because most straight men and women aren’t being tested in their throats. Kissing may be one way in which it spreads from throat-to-throat in a community, eventually causing genital infections through oral sex.

## Why Not Recommend That Everyone Test Throats for Gonorrhea?

For an individual, three site testing may be the right decision, especially if you engage in oral sex with new or multiple partners, participate in group sex, have sex with partners who also have other partners, or are part of a community where STI rates are known to be high.

For the entire population, public health officials must weigh: how commonly does this occur, how beneficial is early detection and treatment, how much does it cost compared to not doing this and just treating people when they have symptoms, and is limited funding better used for something else?

Doctors are already advised to screen asymptomatic patients for gonorrhea and chlamydia in the genitals using urine testing. Adding two more sites costs more both in dollars and time. Providers often don't offer it, and patients, especially outside LGBTQ+ communities, don't know to ask for it.

## Should You Get Tested in Your Throat?

We need to start looking for gonorrhea in all the places it persists, regardless of sexual identity or behaviors. If you are sexually active, I recommend getting tested in your throat, genitals, and anus regularly. If your provider hesitates, advocate for yourself by showing them this article and the studies on this topic.
