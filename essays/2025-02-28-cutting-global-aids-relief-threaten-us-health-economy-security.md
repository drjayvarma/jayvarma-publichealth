Journalists and foreign policy experts have [written extensively about the suffering](https://www.nytimes.com) caused by the Trump administration’s decision to halt food, health care, and other forms of assistance to some of the poorest people in the world. Given income inequality and the fragility of the social safety net in the United States, I am not surprised that some Americans approve, thinking, “Why are we spending money on people in other countries when it could be spent here, like to pay my health care bills?”

Defenders of foreign assistance rightly point out that it accounts for [only a tiny fraction of the U.S. budget (about 1%)](https://www.pewresearch.org) and that there has long been a bipartisan consensus that the wealthiest nation in the world has an ethical obligation to help people in other countries. One reason that popular support for foreign assistance has eroded is that many Americans are unaware that it directly benefits our own health, economic growth, and physical security. The most obvious example is U.S. foreign health assistance, such as through the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief.

## What is PEPFAR, and how does it work?

The U.S. President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) under President George W. Bush started as a $15 billion commitment spread over five years to support 15 countries around the world, then eventually expanded to support more than 50 countries.

PEPFAR operates by directly funding health programs in recipient countries, working with governments, non-governmental organizations, and local health providers. The program provides antiretroviral therapy (ART), supports prevention (including stopping HIV transmission from mothers to their newborn babies), and strengthens overall health care infrastructure, including clinics, labs, and supply chains.

Through PEPFAR, U.S. government agencies, such as USAID and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, assign physicians, epidemiologists, lab scientists, and experts in related fields to live and work in these countries. The job was to work with the foreign government agencies and NGOs funded by PEPFAR and ensure that U.S. taxpayer money was spent wisely on saving lives and preventing infections.

Since its inception, PEPFAR has, in fact, [saved over 25 million lives](https://d.docs.live.net) through ART, prevented HIV infections in 5.5 million babies, and increased life expectancy in PEPFAR-supported countries, an accomplishment that has been celebrated by people from [different political backgrounds](https://www.kff.org).

## My experience with infectious disease control abroad

In 2003, I moved with my family from the CDC’s headquarters in Atlanta to Bangkok, Thailand to serve as the first CDC regional adviser to Southeast Asia for tuberculosis control. My job was to support the Ministries of Health in Thailand, Cambodia, and Vietnam with improving diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of TB.

At that time, HIV was spreading rapidly throughout Southeast Asia, because treatment was still not widely available. When HIV infection suppresses the immune system, it makes people exquisitely susceptible to developing severe illness and death from TB. Despite highly effective drugs against both TB and HIV, [TB remains one of the world’s leading killers](https://www.who.int) of people and the number one killer in people with HIV infection.

The U.S. government has a direct interest in supporting global TB control, because [most TB cases in the United States](https://www.cdc.gov) arise in people who acquired their infection overseas (76% in 2023). As we have learned from Covid-19, Ebola, and mpox in the past 10 years, any disease around the world can readily spill over into the United States. (While I was based in Thailand, for example, I helped lead the response to an [outbreak of multidrug-resistant TB](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov) among refugees being resettled to the United States.)

My assignment in Thailand was initially funded by money that had been appropriated by Congress in 1999 for the [“Leadership in Fighting an Epidemic” initiative](https://clinton.presidentiallibraries.us). Through that funding, the CDC assigned experts like me to countries with a severe HIV burden to help them prevent, care, and treat people with HIV and control associated diseases, like TB. Soon after I moved to Bangkok in 2003, Bush made the decision to super-charge the LIFE initiative and turn it into PEPFAR.

## Cutting PEPFAR threatens U.S. health

Twenty-two years later, cutting PEPFAR funding has immediate harmful consequences. Some of the world’s leading mathematical modelers in infectious disease previously collaborated to estimate what would happen to HIV infections and deaths if services were interrupted due to COVID-19 control measures. Adapting that model to the current situation, they estimate that [thousands of adults and babies](https://pepfarimpact.vercel.app) may have died already from the decision to halt PEPFAR services.

Why should Americans worry about this?

When millions of people reliant on ART have their treatment interrupted or receive drugs only intermittently, we create the ideal environment for the emergence of drug-resistant HIV strains — infections that will eventually spread to the United States and directly imperil the health of Americans. There is a similar risk of drug resistance emerging and spreading for TB, because [the U.S. government is the largest donor](https://www.cidrap.umn.edu) of TB drugs and care through PEPFAR and other U.S. assistance programs. Without treatment, other infectious diseases may emerge too; patients with HIV develop severely impaired immune systems and then become a population in which new pathogens evolve or cause outbreaks, such as [new variants of Covid-19](https://www.nature.com) and [mpox](https://www.thelancet.com).

One important way that the U.S. government learns about outbreaks of emerging diseases is because we have CDC and USAID personnel in these countries working with ministries of health, the World Health Organization, and other health groups. Every time a new disease threat has emerged, these personnel have been instrumental in verifying what is happening, continuously monitoring the threat so that the United States can prepare adequately for it, and helping to slow or stop it from spreading to the United States.

The most dramatic example is how [CDC personnel assigned to Thailand](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov) were critical in identifying and responding to the first cases of SARS in 2003, which gave the world a fighting chance to prevent the disease from spreading globally. Without U.S. personnel embedded abroad, we will be blind to the next health threat.

## Cutting PEPFAR threatens U.S. economic growth and security

Beyond health, PEPFAR is one of the most successful foreign assistance programs in advancing U.S. global leadership. In countries that receive PEPFAR support, it has strengthened health systems, built goodwill toward the U.S., and helped stabilize societies.

Weakening or dismantling PEPFAR undermines U.S. credibility, cedes influence to geopolitical rivals like China and Russia, and increases instability in fragile states. That instability often translates into increased migration pressures, terrorism risks, and economic disruption — all of which affect the United States directly.

Cutting PEPFAR is not just a matter of withdrawing charity. It is dismantling one of the most effective tools we have for safeguarding our health, economy, and national security.
